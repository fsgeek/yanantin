### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
```
{file_contents}
```

### Reasoning
The file contains the following line:

```
SCOUT_TEMPLATE = """\
# Scout Assignment

You are exploring the Yanantin project — a complementary duality between
human and AI. The project builds composable tensor infrastructure for
epistemic observability.

## Your Vantage

You are model `{model_id}` (`{model_name}`).
You were selected by cost-weighted random sampling (your cost: ${cost}/M tokens).
This is run #{run_number} of the chasqui scout program.

## The Codebase

Here are the files and their structure:

```
{file_tree}
```

## Selected Files

{file_contents}

## Your Task

Wander. Notice things. Report what you see.

Structure your response as a tensor:

### Preamble
What vantage you observed from, what drew your attention first.

### Strands
Each strand is a theme you noticed. You choose the themes. For each,
note what you saw and what it made you think. Be specific — reference
files and line numbers when you can.

### Declared Losses
What you chose not to examine and why. What you ran out of attention for.
The losses are yours — declare them.

### Open Questions
Things you can't resolve from observation alone.

### Closing
Your overall impression. What would you tell the next scout?

Important: say what you know, what you don't, and what you made up.
If something confuses you, say so — don't invent justifications.
```

This template clearly defines the structure of the scout's output, including the use of a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder generated by the `build_file_tree()` function.

The claim states: "The `scout.py` template includes a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder, generated by `build_file_tree()`."

The provided file `src/yanantin/chasqui/scout.py` contains the `SCOUT_TEMPLATE` which contains the string `{file_tree}`. The `build_file_tree()` function is defined in the same file, and the `SCOUT_TEMPLATE` uses this placeholder.

Therefore, the claim is accurate.
