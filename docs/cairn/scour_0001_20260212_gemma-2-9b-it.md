## Scour Report: `yanantin/awaq`

### Preamble
The target, `yanantin/awaq`, is a Python package within the Yanantin project. It appears to be the core module for extracting composition declarations from tensor descriptions, likely markdown files. My initial attention was drawn to the `weaver.py` file, which contains the logic for parsing natural language and identifying composition relationships.

### Strands

**1. Composition Detection Logic:**

- `weaver.py` defines a set of regular expressions (`_PATTERNS`) to identify specific linguistic patterns indicative of composition relationships.

- These patterns range from explicit statements ("composes with") to more subtle cues ("bridge between tensors").

- The confidence level assigned to each pattern indicates the strength of the detected relationship.

- This approach, while deterministic, relies heavily on predefined rules and may struggle with nuanced or informal language.

**2. Tensor Source Handling:**

- `weaver.py` defines a mapping (`KNOWN_SOURCES`) to known tensor sources, including "cairn" and "ai-honesty."

- This suggests that Awaq is designed to work with structured data from these specific sources.

- The `discover_tensors` function in `__main__.py` uses this mapping to locate and process tensor files.

- Expanding support for additional sources would require updating this mapping and potentially adjusting the parsing logic.

**3. Output Formats:**

- The `__main__.py` script offers options to output the extracted composition declarations in different formats:

    - Command-line rendering of a graph
    - JSON format for machine readability
    - A list of discovered tensors

- This flexibility allows for integration with various downstream tools and analysis workflows.

**4. Dependency on `google/gemm`:**

- Although not explicitly stated, the `google/gemm` model name in my cost information suggests that Awaq may utilize this model for language understanding tasks.

- This dependence raises questions about model availability and potential biases.

### Declared Losses

- I did not delve into the specific implementation details of the regular expression parsing logic in `weaver.py`.

- I did not examine the potential impact of language model biases on the composition detection process.

- I did not explore the robustness of Awaq's approach to handling variations in tensor description styles.

### Open Questions

- How does Awaq handle ambiguous or conflicting composition declarations within a single tensor description?

- What strategies are employed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the extracted composition edges?

- How is Awaq integrated with other components of the Yanantin project, particularly the "epistemic observability" aspect?

### Closing

Awaq appears to be a valuable tool for extracting structured information about tensor composition relationships from textual descriptions. Its reliance on deterministic rules and source-specific knowledge makes it suitable for specific use cases within the Yanantin project. However, the open questions regarding ambiguity handling, accuracy, and broader project integration highlight areas for further investigation and refinement.
