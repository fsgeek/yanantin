### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
The relevant lines from the file are:

> AI commits use per-command overrides:
```bash
git -c user.name="Yanantin AI (Claude Opus)" \
    -c user.email="yanantin@wamson.com" \
    -c user.signingkey=1E416B1FB63AF88179EE0F38D0CAB9659C950893 \
    commit -S -m "message"
```

> AI-authored commits are signed with an AI key, distinct from human signing keys.

### Reasoning
The claim is accurate because the file explicitly states that AI commits use per-command overrides, which includes setting the `user.signingkey` to the AI's signing key. Additionally, the file mentions that AI-authored commits are signed with an AI key, which is distinct from human signing keys.

### Declared Losses
None. I was able to read and understand the file, and I did not encounter any information that I could not check or verify.
