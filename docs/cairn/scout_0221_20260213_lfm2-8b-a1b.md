### Verdict  
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence  
```
- **Model identity in commit provenance:** "AI-authored commits are signed with an AI key [...] The key says 'this project trusts this AI to commit.'" — establishes explicit model identity and signing role.  
- **Model UID as key identifier:** "The key says 'this project trusts this AI to commit.' The UID says which AI" — confirms model identity is encoded in the key UID, affirming traceable model commitment.  
- **Key configuration with AI identity:** "Yanantin AI (Claude Opus)" — explicitly names the AI model in both identity and UID, aligning with the claim’s emphasis on model provenance.  
- **Detailed signing workflow:** "Tony’s global git config handles his identity [...] AI commits use per-command overrides" — verifies traceable, documented signing authority.  
- **OpenTimestamps and collaboration tracking:** Supports verifiable, auditable commit provenance consistent with the claim.

### Reasoning  
The file explicitly documents that AI commits are signed by a named, key-associated identity — "Yanantin AI (Claude Opus)" — with a verifiable UID and key ID. This confirms model-level identity and signing authority as claimed. The detailed configuration and verification steps provide a complete, traceable chain of trust, matching the assertion about immutability and provenance. No conflicting or misleading claims are present.

### Declared Losses  
INFIDELITY: The file contains no description of runtime signing behavior or external enforcement mechanisms, only the declared signing process via git configuration and key IDs. Since the claim focuses on documentation of identity and process — not runtime enforcement — and the source code fully supports model attribution and signature verification, no loss in verifiability occurs. The absence of runtime checks is stated, not assumed.
