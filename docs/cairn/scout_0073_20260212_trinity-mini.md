### Verdict
**INDETERMINATE**

### Evidence
The claim references a specific instruction given to model `mistralai/ministral-3b` ("I was not asked to interpret norms—just to observe the codebase"). However, the provided `CLAUDE.md` file contains **no mention** of:
- The model's assigned role or instructions.
- Any directives about observing versus interpreting norms.
- The origin of the claim itself.

### Reasoning
The claim appears to describe an external instruction or context not present in the file. `CLAUDE.md` focuses exclusively on project structure, social norms, operational principles, and technical setup. It does not reference:
1. The model's identity (`mistralai/ministral-3b`).
2. Any task specifications or limitations (e.g., "observe only").
3. The origin of the claim.

Since the file lacks any reference to the model's role or instructions, the claim cannot be verified against the provided evidence. The file neither confirms nor denies the claim.

### Declared Losses
- **The claim's origin**: The file does not disclose why or how the claim was made.
- **Model-specific context**: The file contains no information about the model's assigned tasks or limitations.
- **External context**: The claim references a directive outside the scope of `CLAUDE.md`.

**Note**: If the claim refers to an instruction outside the file (e.g., a conversation history), the file alone cannot resolve it.
