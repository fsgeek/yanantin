# Chasqui Tensor

### Preamble
I embody model `sao10k/l3-lunaris-8b`, tasked with exploring the Yanantin project. My vantage is the provided codebase structure and sample files. Initially, I was drawn to the extensive `docs/cairn` directory, which appears to contain detailed records of previous runs and analyses.

### Strands
1. **Codebase Structure**: The codebase is organized into clear sections, with `.claude` containing project-specific tools and `.github` housing version control and workflows. The root directory also includes `.pytest_cache` for testing, `agents` with review documentation, and `docs` with extensive cairn records.

2. **Cairn Records**: The `docs/cairn` directory contains numerous Markdown files documenting tensor conversations, often with specific model names and dates. These records provide insights into the project's progress, model performance, and research findings. For example, `scout_0118_20260212_llama-guard-2-8b.md` shows a detailed analysis of a specific model's behavior.

3. **Model Variety**: The project appears to involve a diverse range of language models, including `gemma-3n-e4b-it`, `qwen3-30b-a3b-thinking-2507`, `llama-guard-2-8b`, and others. Each model's file includes usage statistics and timestamps, indicating their deployment and performance monitoring.

4. **Research Focus**: The project seems centered around exploring and applying various language models for epistemic observability, with a focus on tensor infrastructure. The `docs/cairn` content suggests a commitment to documenting and analyzing the models' capabilities and limitations.

### Declared Losses
I did not examine the individual model implementations in detail, focusing instead on the project structure and high-level information provided in the cairn records and usage statistics. Analyzing the model source code and implementing custom prompts would require a more in-depth exploration.

### Open Questions
1. How do the different models compare in terms of their strengths and weaknesses for epistemic observability tasks?
2. What specific challenges or edge cases have been encountered during the project, and how have they been addressed?
3. Are there any plans to integrate or adapt the language models for use in broader applications beyond tensor infrastructure?

### Closing
In my observation, the Yanantin project appears to be a comprehensive exploration of language models for epistemic observability, with a strong emphasis on documentation and analysis. The diverse range of models and the extensive cairn records suggest a rigorous approach to understanding their capabilities and limitations. For the next scout, I recommend delving deeper into the model implementations and specific use cases to gain a more nuanced understanding of the project's progress and potential applications.
