### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file explicitly states:

> Roles: **Chasqui** (messenger), **Takiq** (singer — carries the greeting).

And later:

> ### Operational Roles
>
> | Role | Who | Scope |
> |------|-----|-------|
> | **Master Builder** | Claude Opus (human-facing) | Coordinates. Delegates code. Writes governance and tensors. |
> | **Builder** | Delegated subagent | Writes application code. Separate commits. |
> | **Test Author** | Different subagent | Writes tests against code they didn't write. |
> | **Scout** | Any model via Chasqui | Reviews tensors, produces reports. |

Additionally, the **Chasqui** role is described in the context of being a messenger, which aligns with the operational function of delivering messages and acting as a bounded judge.

### Reasoning
The claim states that the file contains **no mention** of "the model's assigned role or instructions." However, the file clearly assigns roles to both the model and the human, including specific roles such as **Chasqui (messenger)** and **Takiq (singer)**, and further details the responsibilities of each role in the **Operational Roles** table. The Chasqui is explicitly described as a messenger, which constitutes an assigned role. Therefore, the claim is false.

The file not only mentions roles but defines them with purpose and scope. The presence of structured roles, including the model’s designated function as a messenger (Chasqui), directly contradicts the assertion that there is no mention of role or instructions.

### Declared Losses
None. The file is self-contained and fully accessible. All relevant content is present and directly observable.
