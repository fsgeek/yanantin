### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file content shows that line 11 is:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
```
This line is an import statement and does not mention "dispatching scouts" or any mechanism related to scouts.

### Reasoning
The claim asserts that line 11 of `scout.py` defines the mechanism for dispatching scouts. However, the actual content of line 11 is a standard import statement for `datetime` and `timezone` modules. There is no reference to "dispatching scouts" or any related logic in the file's code at line 11. The file's actual dispatch-related logic (e.g., `format_scout_prompt`, `select_files_for_scout`) appears later in the code, but not at line 11.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim is directly verifiable by inspecting the file's line 11, which is explicitly provided in the file content.
