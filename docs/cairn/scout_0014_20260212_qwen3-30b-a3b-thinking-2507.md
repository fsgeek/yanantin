{
  "Preamble": "Observed from model `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-thinking-2507`, selected by cost-weighted random sampling. First attention drawn to `docs/cairn/T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` and `tests/red_bar/test_provenance.py`, which emphasize provenance tracking and structural invariants.",
  "Strands": [
    {
      "Theme": "Provenance as Structural Invariant",
      "Observation": "In `test_provenance.py`, every record class (e.g., `TensorRecord`, `CompositionEdge`) explicitly requires a `ProvenanceEnvelope`. This enforces immutability and lineage tracking, as seen in `test_stored_records_retain_provenance`.",
      "Thought": "The project treats provenance as non-optional, aligning with CLAUDE.md's 'Provenance Is Structural' principle. This contrasts with typical codebases where metadata is an afterthought."
    },
    {
      "Theme": "Scout Prompt Engineering",
      "Observation": "The `scout.py` template includes a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder, generated by `build_file_tree()`. This suggests a focus on contextual awareness, though the tree is truncated at 4 levels.",
      "Thought": "The file tree construction avoids noise (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`) but may miss deeper directory structures. The `select_files_for_scout()` function prioritizes source files (.py, .md) over binaries."
    },
    {
      "Theme": "Tensor Schema in Documentation",
      "Observation": "Files like `docs/cairn/scout_0002_20260210_llama-3-8b-instruct.md` show structured tensors with sections like 'Strands' and 'Declared Losses'. The `T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` tensor explicitly mentions 'semantic scaffolding' and tokenization analysis.",
      "Thought": "The project uses markdown as both documentation and data format. This dual-purpose design may enable automated parsing but risks ambiguity in complex cases."
    }
  ],
  "Declared Losses": [
    "Did not examine `src/yanantin/tinkuy/audit.py` in depth, as focus remained on scout workflows and provenance.",
    "Avoided analyzing `scripts/ingest_cairn.py`'s data ingestion pipeline due to time constraints.",
    "Did not verify if `CLAUDE.md`'s 'No Theater' principle is enforced in all code paths."
  ],
  "Open Questions": [
    "How does the project handle provenance for generated files (e.g., `logs/chasqui.log`)?",
    "What mechanisms ensure consistency between `docs/cairn` tensors and the actual codebase state?",
    "Are there plans to formalize the 'semantic scaffolding' concept into a measurable metric?"
  ],
  "Closing": "The Yanantin project prioritizes epistemic observability through rigorous provenance tracking and structured reporting. Scouts act as both observers and architects of this system. The interplay between human-AI collaboration (e.g., 'Tinkuy' confluence) and technical rigor is its defining tension. Next scouts should focus on verifying how these principles scale with larger codebases and more complex tensors."
