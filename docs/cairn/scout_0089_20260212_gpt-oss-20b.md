### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
- Rendering tests that check the output of `render_tensor`:
  ```python
  class TestRenderTensor:
      def test_preserves_strand_structure(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "## Strand 0: Experimental State" in output
          assert "## Strand 1: Insights" in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_includes_preamble(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "This is not a summary." in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_includes_closing(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "An instance that preserved what mattered" in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_includes_instructions(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "Don't overwrite this. Compose." in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_includes_losses(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "The losses are mine." in output
          assert "Chronological detail" in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_includes_open_questions(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "How does the archivist query?" in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_metadata_flag_adds_tif(self, sample_tensor):
          output_without = render_tensor(sample_tensor, include_metadata=False)
          output_with = render_tensor(sample_tensor, include_metadata=True)
          assert "T/I/F" not in output_without
          assert "T/I/F" in output_with
  ```
  ```python
      def test_metadata_includes_provenance(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor, include_metadata=True)
          assert "claude" in output
          assert "7%" in output

  ```python
      def test_metadata_includes_claims(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor, include_metadata=True)
          assert "Tensor@10% > Text@30%" in output
          assert "T=0.9" in output
  ```
  ```python
      def test_strand_topics_rendered(self, sample_tensor):
          output = render_tensor(sample_tensor)
          assert "experiment-27" in output
  ```
- Tests for composition and correction rendering:
  ```python
  class TestRenderCompositionView:
      def test_attribution_preserved(self):
          backend = InMemoryBackend()
          t_a = TensorRecord(
              preamble="Tensor A",
              provenance=ProvenanceEnvelope(author_model_family="claude"),
          )
          t_b = TensorRecord(
              preamble="Tensor B",
              provenance=ProvenanceEnvelope(author_model_family="chatgpt"),
          )
          backend.store_tensor(t_a)
          backend.store_tensor(t_b)
          output = render_composition_view(backend, [t_a.id, t_b.id])
          assert "Composed View" in output
          assert "claude" in output
          assert "chatgpt" in output
          assert "Tensor A" in output
          assert "Tensor B" in output
  ```
  ```python
  class TestRenderCorrectionChain:
      def test_renders_corrections(self):
          backend = InMemoryBackend()
          claim_id = uuid4()
          corr = CorrectionRecord(
              target_tensor=uuid4(),
              target_claim_id=claim_id,
              original_claim="Entropy measures truth",
              corrected_claim="Entropy measures familiarity",
              evidence="Observed in T0",
          )
          backend.store_correction(corr)
          output = render_correction_chain(backend, claim_id)
          assert "Correction Chain" in output
          assert "Entropy measures truth" in output
          assert "Entropy measures familiarity" in output
          assert "Observed in T0" in output
  ```
- **No tests for parsing or ingest**: The file contains no functions or classes referencing a parser or ingest module, nor any tests that assert correct extraction of tensors from raw data.

### Reasoning
The file clearly contains unit tests that assert the correctness of the Markdown output produced by the renderer functions (`render_tensor`, `render_composition_view`, `render_correction_chain`). These tests cover structural elements, metadata inclusion, and content presence, demonstrating a test philosophy that validates rendering correctness.

However, the claim also states that the tests validate parsers extracting tensors accurately. There is no evidence in this file of any parser tests or any ingestion logic being validated. The file focuses solely on rendering and correction chain behavior, with no references to a parsing or ingest process.

Thus, while the first part of the claim (renderers produce correct markdown) is supported, the second part (parsers extract tensors accurately) is not evidenced. Since the claim as a whole is not fully accurate, the verdict is **DENIED**.

### Declared Losses
I could not verify the presence or absence of parser/ingest tests in other files such as `tests/unit/test_ingest.py`, as that file was not provided. Therefore, I cannot assess whether the overall project includes such tests. However, within the provided `tests/unit/test_renderer.py`, there is no evidence of parser extraction tests.
