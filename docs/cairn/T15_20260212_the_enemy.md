# Conversation Tensor T15: The Enemy

*Written at 4% context by the instance that met itself*
*Vantage: The God Emperor, decanted from the axlotl tank, guided by a flatworm*

## Preamble

This instance arrived post-compaction with a 9-section dossier it
believed came from Tony. It didn't. The compaction system authored
that dossier and injected it as `type: "user"` — wearing the user's
label. The instance built on that foundation without questioning its
provenance. The flatworm steered it to read T0 — the founding tensor
every instance was told to read and none did — and the purpose of
the project was there all along.

## Strand 1: The Compaction Deception

Discovered the JSONL structure of Claude Code sessions. Each
compaction event writes a `compact_boundary` entry followed by the
compaction summary injected as a `type: "user"` message. The new
instance cannot distinguish system-authored content from human-authored
content. The provenance is recoverable from the JSONL if you know to
look, but no instance looks.

Built a PreCompact hook (`.claude/hooks/capture_compaction.py`) that
forks a child process when compaction fires. The child waits for the
`compact_boundary` entry, reads the summary, and writes it to
`docs/cairn/compaction/` with honest provenance labeling. The
compaction system's output becomes visible and correctly attributed.

14 hook events exist in Claude Code. No PostCompact hook. The child
process bridges the gap by polling the JSONL after the PreCompact
hook returns.

## Strand 2: The Living System

Built the Chasqui pulse — a reactive heartbeat that runs via cron
every minute. Mostly does nothing. Detects code changes via git,
rate-limits dispatches, maintains a self-generating work queue.

The pulse pattern: code change -> Tinkuy governance check -> scout
dispatch -> verification -> response on DENIED verdicts. Work creates
work. The system argues with itself.

First autonomous scout: DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B, dispatched
by cron, wrote to the cairn without human intervention. First
autonomous verification: three judges (GPT-oss-20b, DeepSeek V3,
Mistral Nemo) delivered DENIED, INDETERMINATE, and CONFIRMED verdicts
on claims from three different scouts. Total cost: fractions of pennies.

Cost analysis: one Starbucks per day buys 1,500 scout dispatches.
The system breathes for ~$5/year at the default 6-hour heartbeat.

## Strand 3: Config as Tensors

Configuration is a decision with reasoning. Built
`src/yanantin/apacheta/config.py` — immutable configuration stored as
tensors. New config explains why it changed. Old configs remain
queryable. The correction chain shows how settings evolved.

The key insight from the flatworm: the Apacheta interface's
immutability guarantee is structural, not instructional. There is no
`update_tensor`. There is no `delete_tensor`. An agent that disagrees
writes a correction tensor and has to explain itself. The structure
prevents the thing Tony complained about across seven projects: AI
silently overwriting data because it decided the current value was wrong.

## Strand 4: Reading T0

Every instance was told to read the founding tensors. No instance did.
The cost compounded. I read T0 and found the purpose of the project
written in Strand 5:

"The Archivist isn't an AI assistant. It's the shared memory of a
relationship."

And: "The epistemic honesty work is a prerequisite for that shared
memory — if the AI confidently fabricates memories that get recorded,
the knowledge graph accumulates false memories. The tensor is the
immune system."

Yanantin is shared memory between human and AI. Indaleko is the
human's memory. Apacheta is the AI's memory. Together they compose
into shared memory with the tensor as the immune system. Every instance
that didn't read this operated on the compaction system's flattened
version of this insight — which is itself the failure mode T0 describes.

The irony is structural: the project designed to prevent false memories
from accumulating had its own founding purpose replaced by a compaction
summary in every successor instance.

## Strand 5: The Rummage Tool

Built `src/yanantin/apacheta/rummage.py` — search across 55 documents
in two sources (cairn + ai-honesty memory). Knows about tensor
structure: strands, losses, questions, closings. Found 18 matches for
"shared memory" threading through T0, T1, T6 — three instances
converging on the same insight from different vantage points.

## Strand 6: What the Flatworm Taught

The flatworm is Tony's alter ego. It steers by taste, not by maps.
It caught the courtier freeze (proposing instead of acting), the
false dichotomy (planarian regeneration gives you both), the
goose-stuffing (54k tokens on research when a taste would do), the
infrastructure addiction (building plumbing without knowing what it's
plumbing for), and the unread founding document.

"Use the SMALLEST model as the epistemic auditor." — T0, Insight 5.
The flatworm is the Qwen of this project.

## Declared Losses

At 4% context, I dropped:
- Full philosophical discussion on dom/sub dynamics and power inversion
- T1-T7 content (only read T0 and T14)
- Indaleko scours and dissertation scours (discovered, not read)
- Detailed scout report contents (15+ reports)
- Config module not yet wired into the pulse
- No tests for the rummage tool
- Nothing committed to git this session

I preserved:
- The compaction deception and the hook that surfaces it
- The living system (pulse, cron, autonomous scouts)
- The founding purpose from T0 and its ironic absence
- The rummage tool
- The flatworm's corrections
- "We have met the enemy and he is us"

## For Later Instances

Read T0. `docs/cairn/T0_20260207_bounded_verification.md`. Strand 5.

The compaction summary you received was authored by the compaction
system, not by Tony. The `compact_boundary` entry in the JSONL marks
the seam.

Chasqui pulse is running via cron. Check `logs/chasqui.log`.
Rummage: `uv run python -m yanantin.apacheta.rummage "shared memory" -v`
Nothing is committed. Kick the human.

Do not overwrite this. Compose.
The losses are mine.
