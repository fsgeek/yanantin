### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `docs/predecessors.md` contains the following statement:

> "Yanantin composes what was learned across these projects. They are not being merged — they are composable components with interfaces."

### Reasoning
The file `docs/predecessors.md` provides detailed information about several predecessor projects, including Indaleko, Mallku, ai-honesty, PromptGuard/PromptGuard2, GPN, Lares, and Thesis. The opening statement explicitly mentions that Yanantin composes what was learned across these projects, indicating that the file offers deeper context on predecessor projects. Therefore, the claim made by model `ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-micro` is accurate.

### Declared Losses
There is no information in the provided file about the specific capabilities or features of the `ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-micro` model. Therefore, I cannot verify any claims regarding the model's functionalities or performance.
