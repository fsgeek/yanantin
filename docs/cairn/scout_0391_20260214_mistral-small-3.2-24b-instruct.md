### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `docs/predecessors.md` does not contain any mention of `apacheta.md` being substituted with `tensors.md` or any indication that `predecessors.md` was invented. The content lists various predecessor projects and their repositories without any reference to these specific events.

### Reasoning
The claim states that there is no evidence in the file to support the substitution of `apacheta.md` with `tensors.md` or the invention of `predecessors.md`. The file content provided clearly does not mention these specific actions or events. Therefore, the claim is accurate as there is indeed no evidence in the file to support these statements.

### Declared Losses
There are no declared losses as the claim is directly verifiable based on the content of the provided file.
