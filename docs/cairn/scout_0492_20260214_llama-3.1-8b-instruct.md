### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `src/yanantin/chasqui/scout.py` contains the following line:
```
## The Codebase

Here are the files and their structure:

```
{file_tree}
```
This line includes a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder, which is generated by the `build_file_tree()` function.

### Reasoning
The `build_file_tree()` function is defined in the same file and is used to generate the file tree structure. The placeholder `{file_tree}` is used in the `SCOUT_TEMPLATE` string, which is used to construct the scout prompt. This suggests that the `build_file_tree()` function is indeed used to generate the file tree structure, which is included in the scout prompt.

### Declared Losses
None. I was able to verify the claim by checking the file and the relevant functions.
