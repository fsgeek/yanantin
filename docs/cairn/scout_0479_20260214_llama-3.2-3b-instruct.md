### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `docs/blueprint.md` explicitly states that the tensor sequence (T₀-T₇) lives in the project's memory directory, and that it is a core part of the Apacheta tensor database.

### Reasoning
The evidence supports the verdict because the file provides detailed information about the tensor database, including its structure and components. The mention of the tensor sequence (T₀-T₇) and its location in the memory directory is consistent with the claim made by the model `liquid/lfm-2.2-6b`. This suggests that the model has a good understanding of the underlying system and is likely correct in its assertion.

### Declared Losses
I couldn't verify the claim about the `docs/predecessors.md` and `docs/tensors.md` files being explicitly required or referenced by `docs/blueprint.md`. While the file does mention the tensor sequence, it does not explicitly mention these other files.
