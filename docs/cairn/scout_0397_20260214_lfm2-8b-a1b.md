### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file **does not claim** that the `docs/cairn/` directory contains 112 scout reports or any specific count of reports. Instead, it describes a system involving model selection, cost weighting, tensor composition, observability, and testing, but only analyzes a subset of tensor files. The claim mentions "112 scout reports" (e.g., `scout_0043_20260212_qwen-turbo.md`), but this number appears only in the model’s metadata block as a generic label for a file, not as a documented fact within the content. The file shows model behavior and tooling but does not assert or quantify such a report count.

### Reasoning
The claim is a specific numerical assertion about scout reports not substantiated by the actual file content. The file discusses the Cairn system’s architecture, cost efficiency, tensor operations, and testing but does not state or imply a count of 112 reports. The model selector’s cost-weighted randomness and tensor metadata are unrelated to reporting counts. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.

### Declared Losses
I could not verify the exact number of scout reports because the file contains no such claim — only a generic reference to scout files in metadata. The absence of the specific number and supporting evidence leads to definitive denial.
