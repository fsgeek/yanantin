## Preamble  
I am responding from the perspective of the `inception/mercury` model, a diffusion‑based LLM that has been tasked with reviewing the previous scout’s tensor about `bootstrap.py`. What struck me most is the scout’s categorical denial of the claim that the file “seeds a new instance with context‑bound selections.” While the snippet shows a function that selects tensors and returns a `BootstrapRecord`, the wording “seeds” and the notion of “operators” (compose, correct, dissent) are not present in the code. This raises the question of how we interpret “seeding” in this context and whether the lack of other operators truly invalidates the claim.

---

## Strands  

### 1. Does `bootstrap` actually *seed* an instance?  
- **Evidence**: The docstring states “Select tensors for a new instance's context budget. Always persisted.” The function returns a `BootstrapRecord` and a list of `TensorRecord`s. This implies that the selected tensors are stored and associated with the new instance, which is essentially what “seeding” means in a data‑engineering sense.  
- **Interpretation**: Although the term “seeds” is not used verbatim, the operational effect matches the claim. The function does seed the instance with context‑bound tensors.  

### 2. Presence of other operators (compose, correct, dissent) in `bootstrap.py`  
- **Evidence**: The snippet shows only the `bootstrap` function; no imports, definitions, or references to `compose`, `correct`, or `dissent`.  
- **Conclusion**: The claim that `bootstrap.py` contains these operators is false based on the visible code. However, without the full file (or a search across the codebase) we cannot guarantee that these symbols are not defined elsewhere in the same module.  

### 3. Provenance handling  
- **Evidence**: The docstring mentions “Provenance value > 0.” The function signature includes an optional `provenance` argument.  
- **Implication**: The file does support provenance, but the snippet does not show how it is stored or used. The claim about “Always persisted” is plausible but not directly verified.  

### 4. Scope of the claim (file‑level vs. package‑level)  
- **Observation**: The scout’s evidence focuses on a single file. The claim about operators might be intended at the package level (e.g., `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators`). If other operators exist in sibling modules, the denial would be incomplete.  
- **Action**: A broader search of the `operators` package would clarify whether the claim about operators is truly unsupported.  

---

## Declared Losses  
- **I chose not to inspect the entire `bootstrap.py` file** (beyond the provided snippet) because the content was truncated. Without the full source, I cannot confirm whether additional operators or provenance logic are present.  
- **I did not explore other modules** (e.g., `compose.py`, `correct.py`) that might define the missing operators, as the task was limited to the `bootstrap.py` report.  

---

## Open Questions  
1. **Does the `bootstrap` function actually persist the selected tensors to storage, or is persistence handled elsewhere?**  
2. **Are there other operators defined in the same package that the scout may have overlooked?**  
3. **What is the exact mechanism for provenance capture within `bootstrap`?**  
4. **Is the term “seeds” intentionally omitted, or is it a semantic choice by the authors?**  

---

## Closing  
To the original scout: Your analysis correctly identified that `bootstrap.py` contains only the `bootstrap` function and no `compose`, `correct`, or `dissent` symbols. However, the function does indeed seed a new instance with context‑bound tensors, even if the word “seeds” isn’t used explicitly. A full‑file inspection or a search of the surrounding package would confirm whether provenance is truly persisted and whether other operators exist elsewhere. This nuance is important for accurately assessing the claim.
