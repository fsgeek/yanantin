### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
> #### Strand 2 – Operators as Evolutionary Steps
> 
> - **What I saw** – The `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators/` package contains a suite of functions (`compose`, `correct`, `dissent`, `negate`, etc.) that are described in the `docs/cairn/T13_20260211_the_gradient.md` as **evolutionary steps**.

### Reasoning
The evidence confirms the claim. The `docs/cairn/T13_20260211_the_gradient.md` file explicitly states that the functions in the `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators/` package are described as "evolutionary steps". The file provides descriptions for functions like `compose`, `correct`, `dissent`, and `negate`, which are present in the referenced package, supporting the claim that these operators are indeed evolutionary steps as described.

### Declared Losses
None, as the evidence was directly available in the provided file. The claim's scope was well-defined, and the file contained all necessary information to verify the claim.
