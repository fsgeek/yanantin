### Verdict  
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence  
The file explicitly states:  
> *"The file does **not** explicitly mention `scout.py` or line 11 in any way."*  
> *"The closest reference to scout-related content is [...] 1. **Docstring (lines 1-4):** [...] (This refers to the *purpose* of the file's content, not the file `scout.py` itself.)"*  
> *"The file is a **Markdown tensor** (a record of a model's output), not the actual `scout.py` file."*  

### Reasoning  
The claim asserts that `scout.py` (line 11) defines the dispatch mechanism. However:  
1. The file **does not reference `scout.py`** at all. The only mention of "scout" is in the docstring describing the *purpose* of the content (e.g., "Scout dispatch — send a messenger into the codebase"), not the file `scout.py`.  
2. The file **lacks line numbers** (it is a Markdown tensor, not a code file), so "line 11" is irrelevant here.  
3. The file **explicitly denies** the claim, stating it does not mention `scout.py` or line 11. The content is a model's output about scout behavior, not evidence of the code implementation.  

### Declared Losses  
- **No access to `scout.py`:** The file is a report, not the actual source code. I cannot verify whether `scout.py` exists or contains the claimed mechanism.  
- **Line numbers are inapplicable:** The file is structured as Markdown, not a code file with numbered lines.
