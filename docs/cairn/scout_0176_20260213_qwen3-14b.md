### Verdict
DENIED

### Evidence
The file states:  
"- Not a code review (that's the structured reviewer's job)"  
and  
"You are a scout. You observe and report what you see. You are not given a checklist. You are not told what to look for. You wander the codebase and notice what you notice."

### Reasoning
The claim asserts that `scout_reviewer.md` represents a meta-level review where agents review *reports of other agents*. However, the file explicitly states the Scout's role is observational ("observe and report what you see") and specifies it is **not** a code review or checklist-based evaluation. The "structured reviewer" is explicitly designated as the entity responsible for code reviews, not the Scout. The Scout's output format focuses on raw observations of the codebase, not analysis of other agents' outputs. Thus, the claim of "meta-level review" is inconsistent with the file's content.

### Declared Losses
None. The file's content fully addresses the claim's implications.
