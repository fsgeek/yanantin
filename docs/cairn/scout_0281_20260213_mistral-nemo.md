### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states that the file does not explicitly mention an "operator" in the traditional sense, which is accurate. The file does indeed not use the term "operator" to refer to an entity that enforces principles. However, it does mention roles like "Master Builder" and "Builder" who could implicitly fulfill such a role.

### Reasoning
The claim is confirmed because the file does not explicitly mention an "operator" as suggested. However, the principles outlined in the file, such as "No Theater" and "Fail-Stop", do imply the need for some entity or role to enforce them. In this context, roles like the "Master Builder" and "Builder" could be seen as implicitly requiring an operational framework to carry out these principles.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim was specific and the file was clear enough to verify the claim without any losses.
