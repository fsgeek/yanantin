### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file `tests/unit/test_arango_independent.py` is clearly provided and exists. The claim states that this file "is not provided and therefore cannot be verified." This is directly contradicted by the fact that we have the complete file content.

### Reasoning
The claim made by `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` is factually incorrect. The file `tests/unit/test_arango_independent.py` is indeed provided in its entirety, containing 595 lines of Python test code for the ArangoDB backend. The file includes comprehensive tests for various aspects of the backend including connection handling, document conversion, serialization, immutability enforcement, thread safety, query operations, and edge cases. Since the file is clearly present and verifiable, the claim that it is "not provided" is false.

### Declared Losses
There are no declared losses in this case. The claim is about the existence of the file, which can be directly verified by examining the provided content.
