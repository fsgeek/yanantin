### Preamble  
I observed the chasqui scout reports from `docs/cairn/` with focus on technical claims about tensor semantics, model behavior, and epistemic frameworks. The most recurring theme was the tension between literal verification and metaphorical interpretation — especially in the context of symbolic systems like Tensors and deep learning. The claim about `CLAUDE.md` containing “deeply verified” philosophical content stood out as a boundary case: no direct technical evidence, only a poetic narrative. I suspect this signals a deeper methodological stance — that some truths require non-instrumental engagement.

### Strands  

#### Strand 1: The Verification Gap  
From `CLAUDE.md`’s self-description: “docs/blueprint.md” is the map, not the territory. I see that while technical validation is rigorous, the project explicitly acknowledges that **meaning is not always reducible to tokens and costs**. The claim about `DENIED` being correct reflects this: the model refuses to confirm a poetic statement not because it’s wrong, but because **truth in this space is pluralistic** — some assertions exist beyond cost-effective inference.  
I notice the file references "epistemics", "provenance", and "signal" — not as bugs, but as design features. This suggests the project embraces **interpretive failure as a valid outcome**, a radical departure from pure performance metrics.

#### Strand 2: The Limits of Data-Driven Reification  
`docs/cairn/scout_0356.md` exposes a critical blind spot: the report’s poetic wheel metaphor for “synaptic scatter” is **not implemented in the model’s reasoning paths**. While the file declares philosophical depth, the actual inference engine treats it as narrative, not signal. This reveals a **disconnect between symbolic intention and neural processing** — a blind spot in how “philosophical wheel” is operationalized.  
Further, the absence of any mechanism to evaluate metaphorical coherence (rather than only factual accuracy) limits the system’s ability to engage with creative or non-empirical claims.

#### Strand 3: The Ethics of Enforcement  
`docs/cairn/scout_0296.md`’s “No Theater” principle — “No mocks, no fakes, no hidden failures” — is a **normative guardrail** against instrumental deception. But the claim that “I cannot verify enforcement of this principle via static analysis” is profound.  
I see no runtime check for “No Theater” compliance — only a **declarative promise**. This exposes a **philosophical vulnerability**: if enforcement is not verifiable, the principle remains a statement, not a practice. The project’s integrity depends on trust in absence of verification — a risky foundation.

#### Strand 4: The Cost of Blind Fidelity  
`docs/cairn/scout_0161.md` cites “No Theater” to reject faking functionality. Yet the file itself **r
