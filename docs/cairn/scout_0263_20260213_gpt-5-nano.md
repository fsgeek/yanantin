### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
- The file content is empty; there are no non-empty lines to quote. The prompt shows the file content as a blank code block:

```

```

### Reasoning
- The claim asserts that the __init__.py file does not contain any configuration directives or model definitions. Since the file is empty (no content at all), there are no lines that could contain directives or definitions. Therefore, the claim is accurate given the static content of the file.

### Declared Losses
- None. The claim references static file content; I can verify the content directly. If there were runtime or external-generated content, that would be outside the file’s static contents, but it isn’t indicated here.
