I've observed the following:

### docs/cairn/scout_0056_20260212_wizardlm-2-8x22b.md

*   The file `weaver.py` does not mention merging styles.
*   The `weaver.py` file focuses on parsing and extracting composition declarations from tensor prose.
*   The term "weave" is used in the filename and a function name (`weave_corpus`), but it refers to extracting and organizing tensor relationships, not merging styles.
*   The codebase does not contain any style-related operations or references.

*   The project is self-reflective and design-driven, with a focus on making knowledge evolution explicit and auditable.
*   The project treats every artifact, including signed commits, immutable Apacheta records, and operator functions, as part of its knowledge graph.
*   The project's design philosophy emphasizes epistemic observability, loss-awareness, and model-awareness.
*   The project's narrative and poetic provenance are embedded in the scout reports, which are a form of narrative provenance.
*   The project's architecture decision about the cairn question is to leave the tensor files in the staging area and not over-organize them.
