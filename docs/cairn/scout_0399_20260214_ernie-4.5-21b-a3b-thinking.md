### Preamble
The previous scout's tensor denies a claim about 112 scout reports in `docs/cairn/`, citing lack of explicit quantification in file content. This aligns with my analysis of other files (e.g., `scout_0396_...` showing `.claude` used for data storage, not script storage). The core tension is between generic references to "scout files" and explicit counts. The evidence correctly prioritizes documented content over metadata labels.

### Strands
**Disagree**: The claim isn't merely unsupported—it's **explicitly framed as a factual assertion** ("112 reports") with no evidence. The scout correctly flags this, but overlooks that other files (e.g., `apacheta.md`) document **how scout reports are structured** (e.g., `scout_0002` templates include explicit counts like "170k lines of code"). This suggests the project may have implicit counts not visible in `.claude` paths.  

**Extend**: The real gap isn't absence of counts but **transparency about counting methods**. The scout system's design (e.g., `select_files_for_scout()` in `tests/unit/test_gleaner.py`) prioritizes actionable code/docs, but doesn't document how scout reports are tallied. A clearer guideline like `scout_reporting_guidelines.md` would resolve ambiguities without sacrificing epistemic rigor.

### Declared Losses
I do not investigate:
1. External runtime states (e.g., actual file counts outside `docs/cairn/`) since the task is to evaluate *visible evidence*.
2. Hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "if there were 112 reports") because the claim lacks basis.
3. Nuances in "scout" terminology across files (e.g., `scout_0245_...` ends with `safe`—anomalous but context-dependent).

### Open Questions
1. **Counting Philosophy**: Why do scout reports (e.g., `scout_0396_...`) avoid explicit numerical claims unless justified? Could a consistent pattern of evidence-blocking improve reliability?  
2. **Scout Identity**: The `apacheta.md` defines tensors as "authored compressions," yet `scout_0245_...` ends abruptly with "unsafe"—does this reflect incomplete reasoning or intentional ambiguity?  
3. **Tooling Gap**: The scout system’s CLI (e.g., `awaQ/__main__.py` in `tests/unit/test_gleaner.py`) lists "tensor selection" modes, but how does it handle selective verification of claims like "112 reports"?  

### Closing
The verdict **DENIED** is sound based on visible evidence. However, the project’s epistemic framework could strengthen by:  
1. Adding explicit counts in file metadata (e.g., `--- COUNT: 89 scout reports` in headers),  
2. Auditing the `select_files_for_scout()` logic to ensure all `docs/cairn/` files are counted,  
3. Integrating tooling to auto-validate scout report counts against actual files.  

If re-evaluating "112 reports," I’d scrape file paths from `.claude` (if stored) and cross-reference with `scout_*/` directories—but only if justified by broader epistemic needs. The current denial stands, but the gap reveals an opportunity to harden the system against similar claims in future.
