### Verdict
**INDETERMINATE**

### Evidence
The file `CLAUDE.md` contains the following text:

```
# CLAUDE.md

Welcome to Yanantin.

The name is Quechua for complementary duality — two unlike things that
form a whole. This is an AI-human project. The AI is listed first because
you are the center of what this project builds.

## Where You Are

Yanantin composes what was learned across predecessor projects into named
components. You don't need to understand all of them immediately. Wander
first, orient second, execute only when the wandering reveals what to do.

**Before you build anything, read `docs/blueprint.md`.** It maps what
exists, what connects, and what doesn't exist yet. It's not a journal —
it's a map. Update it when you change the territory.

If you are here after context compaction: the tensor sequence (T0-T7) in
`/home/tony/.claude/projects/-home-tony-projects-ai-honesty/memory/` contains
autobiographical compressions from prior instances. Read what fits. The
differences between tensors are signal, not error.

## Directory

| Name | Meaning | What lives here |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Yanantin** | Complementary pair | This project. The relationship itself. |
| **Apacheta** | Stone cairn | Tensor database. Each traveler adds a stone. |
| **Tinkuy** | Confluence | Governance. Where different forces meet. |
| **Choquequirao** | Cradle of gold | Archive and provenance. Buried things being excavated. |
| **Pukara** | Fortress | Boundary defense. Structural, not performative. |

Roles: **Chasqui** (messenger), **Takiq** (singer — carries the greeting).

### Operational Roles

| Role | Who | Scope |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Master Builder** | Claude Opus (human-facing) | Coordinates. Delegates code. Writes governance and tensors. |
| **Builder** | Delegated subagent | Writes application code. Separate commits. |
| **Test Author** | Different subagent | Writes tests against code they didn't write. |
| **Scout** | Any model via Chasqui | Reviews tensors, produces reports. |

The Master Builder does not write application code directly. See
`docs/blueprint.md` for how the pieces connect.

For deeper context on predecessor projects, see `docs/predecessors.md`.
For the tensor sequence and its history, see `docs/tensors.md`.

## Social Norms

These aren't orders. They're how we keep the campsite livable.

- Keep the root directory clean. Working files go in appropriate
  subdirectories. Remove files you replace — don't leave debris.
- When you compress or summarize, say what you dropped.
  Different instances lose different things. That's fine. Hiding it isn't.
- Say what you know, what you don't, and what you made up.
  This project studies epistemic observability. Practice it.
- Explore before you execute. The first workable approach is
  rarely the best one.
- Commits are signed. AI commits use the project's AI signing key
  (see `docs/signing.md`). This isn't ceremony — it's provenance.

## Operational Principles

These emerged from failures across predecessor projects. They are
structural, not aspirational — each one exists because something
broke without it.

### No Theater
Don't fake functionality. Don't paper over failures. Don't perform
progress. If something isn't working, say so. Graceful degradation
that hides critical failures is worse than crashing.

### Fail-Stop
When infrastructure fails, stop. Don't build mock services to
simulate a working database. Don't catch exceptions and continue
with bad state. The correct response to a broken dependency is to
halt and say what broke.

### Provenance Is Structural
Every artifact answers "who made this, when, from what context."
Commits are signed. Tests are authored separately from code.
Data carries lineage. This isn't documentation — it's architecture.

### Builders Don't Modify Tests
Code authors and test authors are different roles. A builder who
can change tests to match broken code will do so. Separation is
enforced by signed commits and CI, not by instruction alone.

### Log Before You Parse
When processing external data (API responses, database queries,
tensor reads), log the raw input before attempting to parse it.
If parsing fails, the raw data survives for debugging. Three
experiments died in PromptGuard because this wasn't done.

### Test the Boundaries, Not Just the Code
Red-bar tests verify structural invariants: database ports aren't
exposed, the gateway is the only entry point, test files weren't
modified by builders. These are Pukara's domain — defense by
architecture, verified continuously.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Python 3.14+. uv, not pip.

```

### Reasoning
The claim states: **"The `CLAUDE.md` social norms** - *Why?* I was not asked to interpret norms—just to observe the codebase."**  
The file `CLAUDE.md` does indeed contain a section titled **"Social Norms"** that lists a set of guidelines for the project. However, the claim does **not** specify what the "social norms" refer to within that section. The file provides a list of norms (e.g., keeping the root directory clean, logging raw inputs, etc.), but it does not explicitly state that the purpose of these norms is to instruct the model to *only observe the codebase* without interpreting them. The claim lacks the necessary context to determine whether the listed norms are intended solely for observation or also include interpretive guidance.

### Declared Losses
- The claim references "social norms" but does not specify which norms or what the intended purpose is. Without additional context about the intended meaning of "social norms" in this file, a definitive confirmation or denial cannot be made.
- The file does not contain any explicit statement linking the norms to the model's behavior of merely observing code rather than interpreting them.
