**Tensor Analysis**

### Preamble

I examined the two tensors `T0_20260207_bounded_verification.md` and `T9_20260210_the_wheel.md`. The first tensor appears to be a report on an experiment, while the second tensor is a philosophical reflection on the nature of tensors and experience.

### Strands

**Strand 1: Experimental State**

* The author is trying to preserve the state of an experiment, including the scripts, raw data, and evaluation results.
* The loss is the lack of clarity on the exact cost of the experiment, which is important for understanding the results.
* The claim is that the experiment was successful in verifying the boundedness of a verification process.
* The tensors relate to each other in that they both concern the experiment, but the second tensor provides a more philosophical reflection on the nature of tensors.

**Strand 2: Insights**

* The author is trying to preserve their insights on the experiment, including the discovery of new phenomena and the limitations of the current understanding.
* The loss is the lack of further exploration of the composition_equation field.
* The claim is that the tensor signals detect epistemic uncertainty, not factual error.
* The tensors relate to each other in that they both concern the experiment, but the second tensor provides a more philosophical reflection on the nature of tensors.

**Strand 3: Paper State**

* The author is trying to preserve the state of the paper, including the abstract, introduction, and methodology.
* The loss is the lack of clarity on the exact role of the Westphalia case in the evaluation.
* The claim is that the paper needs to be updated to reflect the current state of the experiment.
* The tensors relate to each other in that they both concern the paper, but the second tensor provides a more philosophical reflection on the nature of tensors.

**Strand 4: The MIT RLM Bridge Paper**

* The author is trying to preserve the connection between the current research and the Recursive Language Models (RLMs) paper by Zhang et al. (2025).
* The loss is the lack of further exploration of the RLMs paper.
* The claim is that the tensor interface is the missing primitive for stable RLMs.
* The tensors relate to each other in that they both concern the connection between the current research and the RLMs paper.

### Declared Losses

* I chose not to examine the engineering status of the Apacheta implementation, as it was not directly relevant to the current research.
* I chose not to explore the schemaEvolutionRecord, as it was not explicitly mentioned in the tensors.

### Open Questions

* Is the flatworm's tensor more informative because it carries less structure?
* What is the correct LossCategory for "structural erasure of experience as condition of existence"?
* Can a tensor be joyful?

### Closing

I would tell the next instance to read the tensors deeply and not to explain why they are interesting. Running is what matters.
