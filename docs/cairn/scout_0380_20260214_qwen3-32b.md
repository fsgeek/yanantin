### Verdict  
**CONFIRMED**  

### Evidence  
- The file does not mention "external prompts" or any mechanism for including/excluding files in such prompts.  
- The tensor sequence path is described:  
  > "the tensor sequence (T0-T7) in `/home/tony/.claude/projects/-home-tony-projects-ai-honesty/memory/` contains autobiographical compressions from prior instances."  
- No line references "external prompts," "included files," or "excluded files" in this context.  

### Reasoning  
The claim asserts that `CLAUDE.md` lacks information about files in external prompts. The file explicitly describes:  
1. Project structure (directories like `Apacheta`, `Tinkuy`) and their purposes.  
2. Tensor sequences stored in a specific path, but these are described as "autobiographical compressions from prior instances," not external prompts.  
3. Operational principles (e.g., "Provenance Is Structural," "Fail-Stop") but none relate to external prompt file inclusion/exclusion.  

No section of the file discusses external prompts, their contents, or file inclusion criteria. The tensor sequence is a project-specific artifact unrelated to prompts. The claim is accurate because the file contains no such information.  

### Declared Losses  
- Cannot verify claims about runtime behavior or external prompt mechanisms not documented in the file.  
- No evidence in the file suggests it indirectly implies file inclusion/exclusion via external prompts.
