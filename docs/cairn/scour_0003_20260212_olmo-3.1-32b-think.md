  "tensor": {
    "preamble": "Focused on the `chasqui` module within the Yanantin project. Key entry point: `__main__.py`'s CLI interface, which orchestrates scouting via `coordinator.py`. Noted tension between cost efficiency (via `model_selector.py`) and thoroughness in reporting.",
    "strands": [
      {
        "theme": "Cost-Weighted Exploration",
        "observations": "Model selection in `model_selector.py` prioritizes cheaper models (line 30+), with inverse cost weighting. Free models get nominal $0.001/M cost to avoid zero-division. This could skew observations toward lower-cost but potentially less capable models.",
        "connections": "Impacts `coordinator.py`'s dispatch logic, where model cost is reported in cairn headers (e.g., `--scout` output in `__main__.py`).",
        "line_refs": ["model_selector.py:30-35", "__main__.py:80"]
      },
      {
        "theme": "Structured Provenance and Scoring",
        "observations": "Scout reports include detailed provenance (model ID, cost, tokens) parsed by `scorer.py` (line 30+). Scoring excludes semantic novelty but tracks syntactic metrics like file references and fabrication. The `--score` command aggregates these (see `__main__.py:100-110`).",
        "losses": "Lacked visibility into how 'efficiency' (insight per token) is computed in `scorer.py` due to truncated code.",
        "line_refs": ["scorer.py:30-60", "__main__.py:100-110"]
      },
      {
        "theme": "Cairn as Central Repository",
        "observations": "All outputs are written to `docs/cairn` via filesystem atomicity in `coordinator.py` (line 70+). Scour reports use `scour_NNNN_DATE_MODEL.md` naming to avoid conflict with scout reports. However, no mechanism observed for pruning old entries.",
        "open_questions": "How is cairn size managed? What triggers re-scouring of targets?",
        "line_refs": ["coordinator.py:70-90", "coordinator.py:200-220"]
      },
      {
        "theme": "Ambiguity in 'Tensor' Definition",
        "observations": "The term 'tensor' refers to markdown-formatted reports, not numerical arrays. Structure is flexible (e.g., `scourer.py` templates vary by scope), but lacks formal validation beyond regex-based parsing in `scorer.py`.",
        "confusions": "The epistemic value of this format versus traditional documentation is unclear.",
        "line_refs": ["scorer.py:100-150", "scourer.py:10-50"]
      }
    ],
    "declared_losses": [
      "Did not inspect actual cairn contents or tensor storage format beyond header parsing.",
      "No analysis of error-handling in async dispatch (e.g., `coordinator.py`'s `dispatch_` functions).",
      "Limited visibility into external dependencies like OpenRouter (truncated `coordinator.py` lines)."
    ],
    "open_questions": [
      "How is model performance evaluated beyond cost? (No accuracy metrics in provided code).",
      "Why exclude semantic novelty from scoring? Reliance on 'convergence' across scouts is undefined.",
      "What is the purpose of `--seed` in `__main__.py` if model selection is cost-based?",
      "How are 'losses' in scout reports aggregated to improve future scouting? (Mentioned but not implemented in snippets)."
    ],
    "closing": "The system is modular and cost-aware, but risks surface in model capability tradeoffs and unverified claims. The cairn acts as a collective memory, yet lacks curation. Future work should define metrics for semantic value and integrate feedback loops from scored reports."
