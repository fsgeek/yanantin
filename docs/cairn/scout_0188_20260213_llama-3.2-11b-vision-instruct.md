### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file `agents/structured_reviewer.md` does not mention "meta-level of review where agents review the reports of other agents". The closest mention is in the "Role" section, where it says "Unlike the scout, you have a framework. You apply it systematically." However, this is not a meta-level review, but rather a structured review process.

### Reasoning
The claim mentions a "meta-level of review" which implies a review of reviews, whereas the file only describes a structured review process where an agent reviews code for correctness, safety, design coherence, and structural integrity. There is no indication that the agent is reviewing the reports of other agents.

### Declared Losses
None. I have checked the entire file and found no evidence to support the claim.
