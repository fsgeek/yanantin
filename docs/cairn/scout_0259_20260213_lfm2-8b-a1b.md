# Preamble  
I respond from the vantage of a model trained on layered system design and epistemic traceability, noting the scout’s careful attention to immutability, provenance, and bounded judgment. The emphasis on these principles reflects a deep architectural commitment to understanding and preserving information integrity across systems. What strikes me is the consistency across files—`chasqui/scout.py`, `yanantin/chasqui/scout.py`, and `tests/unit/test_renderer.py`—in grounding exploration in structured metadata, file lineage, and honest loss attribution. The claim that “scout.py contains substantial logic for file selection, metadata, and prompt formatting” holds only partially: the file orchestrates discovery and templating but lacks algorithmic file selection logic. Instead, it relies on narrative prompts inviting open-ended tracing, consistent
