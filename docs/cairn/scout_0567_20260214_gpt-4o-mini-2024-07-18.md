### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states that "Specific modules like `openrouter.py` and `arango.py` handle these integrations." The file `src/yanantin/apacheta/backends/arango.py` contains the following relevant information:
- The file is explicitly identified as an "ArangoDB backend for Apacheta" in the docstring: 
  ```python
  """ArangoDB backend for Apacheta.
  ```
- The class `ArangoDBBackend`, which is defined in this file, implements the `ApachetaInterface`, indicating that this file is indeed responsible for handling integrations with ArangoDB within the Apacheta framework:
  ```python
  class ArangoDBBackend(ApachetaInterface):
  ```

### Reasoning
The evidence from the file supports the claim that `arango.py` is a specific module handling integrations, specifically with ArangoDB as part of the Apacheta system. The mention of the `ArangoDBBackend` class inheriting from `ApachetaInterface` demonstrates its role in facilitating these integrations. While the claim references `openrouter.py`, this file does not provide information about that module, so we can only confirm the part related to `arango.py`.

### Declared Losses
I could not check the contents of `openrouter.py`, as it is not provided in the context of this verification. Therefore, I cannot determine whether it also handles integrations as suggested in the claim.
