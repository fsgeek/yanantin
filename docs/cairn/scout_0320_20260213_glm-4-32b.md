### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states that "The `scout.py` template includes a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder, generated by `build_file_tree()`." In the file, we can see the `SCOUT_TEMPLATE` on lines 31-64, which contains the string `{file_tree}` exactly as claimed. Additionally, the `format_scout_prompt()` function on lines 94-112 explicitly shows that the `file_tree` is generated by calling `build_file_tree(root)` and then passed to the template via `SCOUT_TEMPLATE.format(file_tree=file_tree)`.

### Reasoning
The evidence directly supports the claim. The `SCOUT_TEMPLATE` string contains the placeholder `{file_tree}` as stated, and the code shows that this placeholder is dynamically populated by the `build_file_tree()` function. This matches the claim exactly: there is a template with a `{file_tree}` placeholder, and this placeholder is generated by `build_file_tree()`.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim is about the presence of a template with a placeholder and the function that generates it, both of which are clearly visible in the file. I can confirm the claim without any uncertainty.
