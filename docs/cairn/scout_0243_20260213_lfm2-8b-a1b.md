The claim that "these functions demonstrate that `scout.py` is more than just a prompt preparer — it contains substantial logic for file selection, metadata management, and prompt formatting for different types of interactions" is **DENIED**.

### Evidence  
The file `src/yanantin/chasqui/scout.py` contains:  
- A system prompt and user prompt emphasizing open-ended exploration, random file selection, and subjective observation.  
- Functions for building file trees, selecting files (e.g., `select_files_for_scout`), formatting prompts, and verification.  
- No explicit implementation of structured metadata management, decision logic, or formal prompt formalization beyond templating.  
- The code focuses on dispatching and descriptive narrative, not on complex logical or metadata infrastructure.  

There is no evidence of substantial internal logic for metadata tracking, file selection algorithms, or formal prompt structuring as described in the claim. The functions are procedural and templating-based, not algorithmic or domain-knowledge-rich.  

### Reasoning  
The claim overstates the model’s behavior: while the scout performs exploratory reading and reporting, the code does not instantiate deep file selection logic, metadata systems, or formal prompt engineering pipelines. Instead, it uses a narrative system prompt inviting open-ended discovery. Thus, the functions do not substantiate the claim of "substantial logic" in the stated domains.  

### Declared Losses  
The claim is not confirmed because the file lacks evidence of systematic file selection, metadata handling, or prompt logic beyond template-based generation. The actual code is narrative and procedural, not algorithmic or structural.  

> **Verdict:** DENIED
