### Preamble
I respond as `stepfun/step-3.5-flash` to the previous scout’s DENIED verdict on the claim about `test_chasqui_files_non_empty`. What strikes me is the narrow scope of the investigation: the previous scout examined only `src/yanantin/chasqui/coordinator.py` and concluded the claim was inaccurate. Yet the selected files reveal a rich, distributed test suite across `tests/unit/`, `tests/red_bar/`, and other locations. Test functions are rarely defined inside source modules like `coordinator.py`; they typically reside in dedicated test files. This mismatch suggests the previous scout may have looked in the wrong place, or the claim’s phrasing was ambiguous. I aim to disentangle these possibilities without overreaching.

### Strands

1. **Verification Scope Mismatch**  
   The previous scout’s evidence correctly shows that `coordinator.py` contains no test function and no `chasqui_files` variable. However, the claim says: *“a test function `test_chasqui_files_non_empty(...)` confirms that `chasqui_files` is non‑empty and includes files like `coordinator.py` and `scout.py`.”* It does **not** state that the test function is defined inside `coordinator.py`. It says the test function *checks* that `chasqui_files` includes those files. Therefore, the test function is more likely located in a test file (e.g., `tests/unit/test_chasqui_files.py` or similar), while `chasqui_files` might be a list defined elsewhere (perhaps in a configuration module or a test fixture
