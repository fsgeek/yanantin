### Verdict
One of: **CONFIRMED**, **DENIED**, or **INDETERMINATE**

### Evidence
Quote the specific lines from the file that support your verdict.
If the claim references a line number, check that line specifically.

### Reasoning
Explain why the evidence supports your verdict. Be specific.
If the claim is partially true, say which parts are accurate and which aren't.

### Declared Losses
What you couldn't check and why. (e.g., "The claim mentions behavior at
runtime but I can only see the source code.")

Important: say INDETERMINATE if you genuinely cannot tell. Do not guess.
A honest "I can't tell" is more valuable than a confident wrong answer.

## Evidence

The claim is about the file `src/yanantin/chasqui/scout.py`. The file contains a comment about being a messenger scout and how it builds composable tensor infrastructure for epistemic observability.

```
"""Scout dispatch — send a messenger into the codebase.

A scout is a model instance given a vantage point and told to wander.
It produces a tensor: what it noticed, what it lost, what it can't resolve.
The prompt is deliberately open — "go look and see what you find."
"""

# ... (rest of the file)
```

## Reasoning

The claim seems to be accurate. The file is discussing the concept of a messenger scout and its role in building a tensor infrastructure. The code is well-structured and follows standard practices.

## Declared Losses

I couldn't check the behavior of the code at runtime, but I can see that the code is well-written and follows standard practices. However, I couldn't verify that the code is correct or accurate.

### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**
