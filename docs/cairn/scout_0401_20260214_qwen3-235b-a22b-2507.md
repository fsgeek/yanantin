### Verdict  
**DENIED**

### Evidence  
The file `src/yanantin/chasqui/model_selector.py` is fully provided in the prompt, starting from the module docstring:  
```python
"""Model selection for Chasqui scouts.

Picks models weighted inversely by cost. Cheap models get dispatched
more often. Over time, the cairn accumulates data on which models
notice what — and whether noticing more is worth paying more.
"""
```

And continues through the entire implementation of `ModelInfo` and `ModelSelector`, including methods like `select()`, `load_from_openrouter_response()`, and `stats()`.

### Reasoning  
The claim states: *"The claim mentions the `model_selector.py` file, which is not shown in the provided code."*  
This is self-referential and incoherent. The claim appears to be commenting on its own context — asserting that `model_selector.py` was not provided — but in this verification task, the full content of `model_selector.py` **is** provided. Therefore, the claim is factually incorrect.

There is no ambiguity: the file content is present, complete, and matches the expected path and filename. The claim falsely asserts absence, which is directly contradicted by the evidence.

### Declared Losses  
None. The claim is about the visibility of the file, which is fully accessible in this context. There is no runtime or external behavior referenced that would prevent verification.
