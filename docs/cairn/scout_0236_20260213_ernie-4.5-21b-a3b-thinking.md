# Chasqui Scout Report: Yanantin's Tensor Architecture Audit
## Preamble  
Observing from `model: baidu/ernie-4.5-21b-a3b-thinking` under cost-weighted random sampling ($0.0000/M tokens). Focused wandering revealed two core tensions: (1) Strong provenance enforcement in code (`arango.py` line 45-47) vs. opaque "Declared Losses" in scout reports (e.g., `scout_0227.md`), and (2) Extensive test coverage of structure (`test_arango_independent.py`) but absence of workflow integration tests.  

---

## Strands  
### **Strand 1: Provenance Enforcement vs. Operational Ignorance**  
- **Code-Level Rigor**: `arango.py` lines 45-47 enforces UUID-based immutability. Failed inserts raise `ImmutabilityError` (confirmed in `scout_0128.md` test verification).  
- **Declaration Gap**: Scout reports like `scout_0227.md` explicitly state "Declared Losses" (e.g., runtime behavior gaps) without code evidence. The claim "models volunteering limitations" (`scout_0227.md`) conflicts with no code verification of these claims.  
- **Thought**: Provenance metadata is structurally enforced, but operational reality (e.g., how immutability affects tensor composition) lacks test coverage.  

### **Strand 2: Testing Philosophy — Structure First, Workflow Later**  
- **Positive Evidence**: Tests validate `ProvenanceEnvelope` structure (`test_stored_records_retain_provenance`) and interface versions (`test_composition_edge_has_provenance`).  
- **Critical Gap**: No tests exercise downstream workflows (e.g., logging, validation, decision-making) based on provenance. The `test_stored_records_retain_provenance` only confirms persistence, not utility.  
- **Implication**: The system prioritizes structural integrity over epistemic workflow integration.  

### **Strand 3: Model Awareness — Surface-Level to Nonexistent**  
- **Documented Cases**: `scout_0058.md` mentions predecessor projects but lacks model-specific capabilities.  
- **Blind Spots**: No scout report (e.g., `scout_0141.md`) dissects `ibm-granite/granite-4.0-h-micro` capabilities. The claim "no information about specific capabilities" is verified — no code or tests exist for these models.  
- **Consequence**: Model selection relies on high-level reports, not integrated testing against real-world workflows.  

### **Strand 4: Architecture Components — Deep but Disconnected**  
- **Visible Ecosystem**: Code reveals composition operators (`compose.py`, `negate.py`) and backend abstraction (`apacheta/models/base.py`).  
- **Inaccessible Subcomponents**: `chasqui_heartbeat.sh` and `precompact_tensor.py` (in `.claude/hooks/`) are unverified due to cost-weighted sampling.  
- **Tension**: Deep architectural knowledge exists, but low-cost scout runs prevent deep exploration of critical subsystems like tensor compaction workflows.  

---

## Declared Losses  
1. **Workflow Integration Tests**: No tests verify if provenance metadata drives downstream decisions (e.g., access control, caching).  
2. **Model-Specific Behavior**: Scout reports declare limitations (e.g., `scout_0227.md`) but no code validates these against benchmarks.  
3. **Subcommand Verification**: `chasqui_pulse.py` and `precompact_tensor.py` hooks are unexamined due to cost constraints.  
4. **Error Handling Deep Dive**: No tests validate `ImmutabilityError` behavior in `arango.py` under adversarial conditions.  

---

## Open Questions  
1. **Provenance Utility**: How does `ProvenanceEnvelope` transform into actionable epistemic workflows?  
2. **Cost-Performance Tradeoffs**: Why prioritize structure over workflow integration when attention economics dictate deeper model analysis?  
3. **Backend Flexibility**: How does ArangoDB's immutability affect composition operators like `compose.py`?  
4. **Error Detection**: Can `ImmutabilityError` be triggered via UUID collisions, and how does the system recover?  

---

## Closing  
Yanantin presents a robust tensor architecture with strong provenance guarantees, but current testing focuses on structural integrity at the expense of epistemic functionality. The system acts as a meticulous archivist but neglects the librarian role — missing workflows that turn preserved tensors into actionable knowledge.  

**Advice for Next Scout**:  
- Prioritize **behavioral testing** over structural verification.  
- Invest low-cost runs to probe `chasqui_pulse.py` heartbeat mechanisms.  
- Investigate `tinkuy/succession.py` for tensor schema evolution workflows.  
- Demand model-specific "Declared Losses" with code evidence in scout reports.  

The duality remains: Yanantin excels at preserving tensors but must evolve to become a system that preserves *understanding*.
