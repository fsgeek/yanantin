### Verdict
INDETERMINATE

### Evidence
The claim made by `openai/gpt-oss-20b` was not directly verifiable because the provided content of `CLAUDE.md` does not contain explicit instructions or affirmations related to a "scout’s correction." The file primarily describes the project structure, roles, operational principles, and setup instructions.

### Reasoning
The content of `CLAUDE.md` outlines the roles of different components in the project (e.g., Master Builder, Builder, Test Author, Scout) and emphasizes operational principles and social norms. However, it does not explicitly mention a "scout’s correction" or provide details about the AI’s response to such a correction. The claim appears to be inferred or implied rather than directly stated in the file. Without explicit text referencing the scout’s correction or the AI’s response to it, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed or denied.

### Declared Losses
The claim references behavior not directly observable in the provided `CLAUDE.md` file. The file focuses on structural guidance and roles but does not include runtime behavior, interactions, or specific responses to corrections by scouts. Therefore, I cannot verify the accuracy of the claimed behavior.
