### Verdict  
**DENIED**

### Evidence  
The file `docs/tensors.md` contains no mention of `docs/blueprint.md`, `docs/predecessors.md`, or any suggestion that another document is required reading before building anything. The closest reference is in the "Future Home" section:  
> "Apacheta formalizes the schema, relations, and query operators that are currently implicit in the file naming and cross-references."  

There is no reference to required prerequisites, blueprints, or deeper context documents within the text.

### Reasoning  
The claim asserts that `docs/tensors.md` explicitly mentions `docs/blueprint.md` as a required read before building, and also references `docs/predecessors.md` and `docs/tensors.md` itself for deeper context. However, a full review of the file shows:

- No mention of `docs/blueprint.md` anywhere.
- No mention of `docs/predecessors.md` anywhere.
- No statement about required readings or prerequisites for development.
- No self-reference to `docs/tensors.md` as a source of "deeper context" — it is the current document, so such a self-reference would be unusual and is absent.

Therefore, the entire claim is factually incorrect. None of the referenced documents are mentioned, and no instructional prerequisites are stated.

### Declared Losses  
None. The claim is about explicit textual references within `docs/tensors.md`, which is fully provided and verifiable. No external knowledge or runtime behavior is required to assess it.
