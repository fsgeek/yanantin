### **Verdict**
**DENIED**

---

### **Evidence**
The claim asserts that the **tensor schema** in `scout_report_tensor_schema.md` "formalizes indeterminacy" via:
```yaml
epistemology:
  confidence: enum [high, medium, low, undecidable]
  neutrosophic: {truth, indeterminacy, falsity}  # Explicitly tracks what’s unknown
```
**No evidence of this schema exists in the provided file** (`T10_20260209_post_compaction.md`). The file does not reference `scout_report_tensor_schema.md` or any schema file at all.

The claim also references **Strand 3** ("The compaction boundary") in the file:
> *"What the summary lost: the texture of the conversation."*

This is **partially true**—the file explicitly states:
> *"What the summary lost: the texture of the conversation. Tony's specific words. The moments where the previous instance learned something it hadn't known."*

However, the claim conflates this with the schema claim, which is **not supported by the file**.

---

### **Reasoning**
1. **Schema Claim is False**
   - The file does not mention a schema named `scout_report_tensor_schema.md` or any YAML-based epistemology schema.
   - The file’s content is narrative, not schema documentation.

2. **Strand 3 Claim is Partially True**
   - The file **does** describe the "texture of the conversation" as lost post-compaction (Strand 3).
   - However, this is **not** the same as formalizing indeterminacy in a schema—it’s a **descriptive observation** about lost context, not a structural schema.

3. **No Evidence of Schema Reference**
   - The file’s text does not link to `scout_report_tensor_schema.md` or imply that the schema tracks "indeterminacy" as stated.

---

### **Declared Losses**
- **Missing file context**: The claim references an external schema file (`scout_report_tensor_schema.md`) that does not exist in the provided document.
- **No runtime behavior**: The file is static text, so we cannot verify if the schema was ever used or if the "indeterminacy" tracking was implemented.

---
### **Summary**
The **schema claim is false** (no schema exists in the file). The **Strand 3 observation is true but unrelated to the schema**. The verdict is **DENIED**.
