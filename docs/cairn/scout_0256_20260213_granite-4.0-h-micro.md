### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
- `with pytest.raises(ImmutabilityError): backend.store_tensor(duplicate)`  
  This line explicitly asserts that storing a duplicate tensor with the same UUID raises the `ImmutabilityError` exception.

- `with pytest.raises(ImmutabilityError): backend.store_composition_edge(edge)`  
  Similarly, this line asserts that attempting to store a duplicate composition edge (same UUID) also raises the `ImmutabilityError` exception.

### Reasoning
The file `tests/red_bar/test_immutability.py` contains two test functions: `test_duplicate_tensor_raises` and `test_duplicate_edge_raises`. Both functions use the `pytest.raises` context manager to verify that the `InMemoryBackend` raises an `ImmutabilityError` when an attempt is made to store a tensor or edge with a UUID that already exists. This directly aligns with the claim made by model `qwen/qwen3-32b` that the test file explicitly raises `ImmutabilityError` in such scenarios. The code demonstrates the intended behavior of the `InMemoryBackend` class, confirming the accuracy of the claim.

### Declared Losses
The claim does not specify the behavior of the `InMemoryBackend` class beyond the immutability invariant it enforces. Therefore, while the evidence confirms the claim regarding the exception raised for duplicate tensors and edges, it does not provide information about other potential methods or behaviors of the `InMemoryBackend` class that are not mentioned in the claim. Additionally, the claim does not address the runtime behavior of the backend, only the source code behavior as defined in the test file.
