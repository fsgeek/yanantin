### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The specific lines from the file that support this verdict are:

> #### Strand 3: Testing as a Red-Bar Guard Rail
> The red-bar tests in `tests/red_bar/test_immutability.py` embody the principle that tests are not just for functionality but also for enforcing architectural invariants. For example, the test for immutability (lines 9–12) ensures that the system fails loudly rather than allowing silent modification, reinforcing the ledger-like nature of the tensor store.

### Reasoning
The evidence supports the claim because it explicitly states that the red-bar tests in `tests/red_bar/test_immutability.py` enforce architectural invariants, in addition to testing functionality. The example of the test for immutability (lines 9–12) illustrates this principle by ensuring that the system fails loudly when attempting to modify or delete tensors, thereby reinforcing the ledger-like nature of the tensor store.

### Declared Losses
I couldn't check the runtime behavior of the red-bar tests, as the file only provides source code. I also couldn't investigate how the project handles the performance or scalability implications of these design choices, as this information is not explicitly mentioned in the file.
