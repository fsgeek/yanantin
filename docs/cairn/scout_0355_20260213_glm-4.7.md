### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
Lines 7–8 of the file contain the following text:
```
A flatworm walked in and asked to wander. I was mid-commit on
```

A search of the entire document reveals that the terms **"synaptic scatter"** and **"intentional drift"** do not appear anywhere in the text.

### Reasoning
The claim asserts that the "doctrine of synaptic scatter" is described in lines 7–8 of the file. The actual text at these lines describes a "flatworm" asking to "wander" and the narrator being "mid-commit on T12." The specific phrases cited in the claim ("synaptic scatter," "unit of intentional drift") are entirely absent from the document. Therefore, the claim is factually incorrect regarding both the content at the specified line numbers and the existence of the terminology within the file.

### Declared Losses
None. The file content is complete and searchable.
