### Verdict
DENIED

### Evidence
The file contains test cases for operators like `compose`, `correct`, `dissent`, `negate`, `bootstrap`, and `evolve`, but none of the test code or comments explicitly reference "evolving knowledge" or verify that operators *represent* ways to evolve knowledge. For example:
- `TestEvolve` checks that `evolve()` records version changes and migration notes, but only verifies data persistence, not conceptual knowledge evolution.
- `TestCorrect` ensures corrections are stored, but does not test any knowledge-evolution logic.
- No test case includes assertions about knowledge representation, epistemic change, or semantic evolution.

### Reasoning
The claim asserts the file "verifies that operators *represent explicit ways to evolve knowledge*." However, the test file only verifies the **functional correctness** of operators (e.g., edge creation, data filtering, version tracking). There is no evidence in the code that these operators are explicitly tied to conceptual "knowledge evolution" beyond their literal data manipulation. The term "evolve knowledge" appears only in the claim, not in the file's code or comments.

### Declared Losses
The claim references a conceptual interpretation of the operators ("evolve knowledge") that is not directly testable via the file's code alone. The file's purpose is to validate operator behavior, not to verify abstract knowledge-theoretic claims.
