### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `src/yanantin/tinkuy/audit.py` contains the following docstring at the beginning of the file:

```python
"""Codebase audit tool — generates ground truth from the filesystem.

This module surveys the actual project directory structure and produces
a structured report of what exists. It does NOT parse the blueprint or
any other documentation. A Master Builder instance can compare this
report to what the blueprint claims.

No dependencies on other yanantin modules. Filesystem inspection only.
"""
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that the `tinkuy` governance system is not explored in `audit.py` or `succession.py`. However, the evidence shows that `audit.py` is a codebase audit tool that generates ground truth from the filesystem and does not parse the blueprint or any other documentation. It does not mention anything about the `tinkuy` governance system or its interaction with the broader system. Therefore, the claim is accurate in the context of the provided file.

### Declared Losses
The claim mentions the interaction of `audit.py` with the broader system, specifically the `tinkuy` governance system. However, the file `audit.py` does not contain any information about the `tinkuy` governance system or its interaction with the broader system. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the content of `audit.py`.
