### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
```
"""Base model for all Apacheta records."""

from __future__ import annotations

from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict

class ApachetaBaseModel(BaseModel):
    """Base for all Apacheta data models.
    Follows Pydantic v2 conventions. All models serialize to/from JSON
    via model_dump/model_validate. Immutable once created.
"""
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that `base.py` contains ML model configuration. However, the file content defines `ApachetaBaseModel` as a base model class using Pydantic, not a configuration block for ML models. The documentation describes it as a base data model following Pydantic conventions, not an ensemble of configuration settings for a deep learning model.

### Declared Losses
The claim could imply whether the file actually contains ML configuration – but since the content does not, dismissing it as inaccurate fits.

### Letter
**EXTENSIVE RECONTEXTUALIZATION IS AVOIDED**

### Court of Proof
No definitive evidence of ML configuration exists, so **DENIED** is appropriate.

### Verifiable Record
The code references Pydantic and base class definition but lacks ML-specific configuration divisional features asserted.

**Verdicts** are stringent; guesswork fails here.

**CONFIRMATION || DENIEMENT is CODIFIED.**

### Conclusion
**DENIED**

**QUOTE:** The file defines a Pydantic model class but does not contain ML model configurations.

**Instruction Followed:** Yes.  
**Bounding adjudication occurred.**

### Judgment Timestamp
2027-04-05 (hypothetical; real would be immutable tie arb). 

**END**

### Plain Output Required
### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
```
"""Base model for all Apacheta records."""

```  
### Reasoning  
No ML configuration detected; class is Pydantic-defined base model.  
### Declared Losses  
Could not verify ML model config as no related code appears.  
### Judgment  
DENIED.
