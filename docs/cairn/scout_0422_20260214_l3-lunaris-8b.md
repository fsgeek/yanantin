### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
Lines 13-18 of `model_selector.py` describe the cost weighting used in the `select()` method:
```python
# Inverse cost weighting. Free models get nominal cost of $0.001/M
# to avoid infinite weight while still being heavily favored.
weights = []
for m in self.models:
    cost = m.total_cost_per_million
    if cost <= 0:
        cost = 0.001  # Nominal cost for free models
    weights.append(1.0 / cost)
```
This shows that the cost of each model is inverted as a weight for selection, with free models (cost <= 0) given a nominal non-zero cost to avoid division by zero.

### Reasoning
The evidence demonstrates that the `ModelSelector` implementation indeed prioritizes cheaper models by assigning them higher weights in the selection process. This behavior directly impacts the dispatch logic in `coordinator.py`, which presumably uses the selected model for tasks.

### Declared Losses
I couldn't verify the specific impact on dispatch logic in `coordinator.py` without access to that code. The claim refers to this file, but I can only analyze the provided `model_selector.py`.
