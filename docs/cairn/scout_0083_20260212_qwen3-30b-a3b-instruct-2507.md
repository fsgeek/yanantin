### Verdict
**INDETERMINATE**

### Evidence
The file `src/yanantin/apacheta/models/__init__.py` contains only import statements and a `__all__` list. It does **not** contain the definition of `ApachetaBaseModel`. The actual implementation of `ApachetaBaseModel` is located in `src/yanantin/apacheta/models/base.py`, which is not provided in this verification task.

### Reasoning
The claim states that `ApachetaBaseModel` enforces `extra="forbid"` and `validate_default=True`. These are Pydantic v2 model configuration settings that would be defined within the class definition, typically via a `model_config` attribute. However, the file under review (`__init__.py`) only re-exports the class — it does not define it or include any configuration.

Without access to the actual class definition in `base.py`, it is impossible to verify whether these settings are present. The `__init__.py` file itself does not contain any configuration directives or model definitions.

### Declared Losses
I could not check the implementation of `ApachetaBaseModel` because it is defined in `src/yanantin/apacheta/models/base.py`, which was not provided in the verification request. The claim references behavior of the model class, but the relevant code is outside the scope of the file being reviewed.
