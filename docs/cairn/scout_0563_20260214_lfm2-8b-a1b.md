### Verdict  
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence  
The claim states: *"The gradient changed: orientation became cheaper than guessing,"* supported by:  
> *"The gradient changed: orientation became cheaper than guessing."*  
This is explicitly quoted in **Strand 1: The Coordinator**, confirming the project’s design shift toward structured, testable orientation via ApachetaGatewayClient and real integration tests over guessing.

### Reasoning  
The file documents a deliberate architectural evolution: earlier "building instead of orienting" gave way to **docs/blueprint.md** and **CLAUDE.md**, which formalized orientation as a documented, low-cost operation. The statement reflects a strategic reduction in complexity and risk—exactly the "cheaper orientation" metaphor. The context of testing rigor (e.g., 71 real ArangoDB tests vs. mock-only approaches) validates this shift as intentional and effective.

### Declared Losses  
I cannot assess whether the gradient’s actual runtime behavior was truly optimized beyond the textual design shift. The file contains only structural and procedural claims; I can verify the *intent and construction* of the gradient improvement but not its *performance outcome* during execution. Thus, full empirical validation is beyond scope.

**But:** Based on the documented architectural and testing improvements, the claim aligns with the file’s narrative. The evidence supports the claim as accurately interpreted within the text.
