### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The entire content of `CLAUDE.md` does not contain any mention of:
- Fetching `CLAUDE.md` itself
- Using `CLAUDE.md` as evidence

Relevant sections explicitly reference other files (e.g., `docs/blueprint.md`, `docs/predecessors.md`, `docs/tensors.md`), but no self-reference to `CLAUDE.md` in the context of being fetched or used as evidence.

### Reasoning
The claim is accurate because:
1. The document describes project structure, roles, and principles but never refers to itself as a file to be fetched or used as evidence.
2. All file references point to other documents (e.g., `docs/blueprint.md` in the "Where You Are" section).
3. The Chasqui role is defined as a messenger reviewing tensors and producing reports, but no instruction exists about handling `CLAUDE.md` itself.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim is purely about textual content, which is fully visible in the provided file.
