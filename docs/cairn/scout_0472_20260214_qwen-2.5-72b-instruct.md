### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The claim states that the file `dissent.py` is located in the directory `src/yanantin/chasqui/operators/`. However, the actual file is located in `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators/`.

### Reasoning
The file `dissent.py` is clearly located in the directory `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators/`, as evidenced by the file path provided in the assignment. The claim incorrectly states that it is in `src/yanantin/chasqui/operators/`.

### Declared Losses
None. The file path is clearly stated and can be verified directly from the provided information.
