### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
Here are the lines supporting the claim:

*   "First attention drawn to `docs/cairn/T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` and `tests/red_bar/test_provenance.py`, which emphasize provenance tracking and structural invariants.”
*   “Strands": [ { "Theme": "Provenance as Structural Invariant", "Observation": "In `test_provenance.py`, every record class (e.g., `TensorRecord`, `CompositionEdge`) explicitly requires a `ProvenanceEnvelope`.”

### Reasoning
The file directly supports the claim. The first quoted line explicitly states that the document and a test file both focus on provenance tracking and structural invariants. The second line, within a list of strands, confirms that the `test_provenance.py` file includes a requirement for a `ProvenanceEnvelope` in its record classes – a clear demonstration of provenance tracking. The entire document revolves around themes of provenance and structural invariants as evidenced by the "Strands" section.

### Declared Losses
I could not verify the "bounded judge" concept fully. The description of it is present, but the actual implementation details and how it functions in practice are not detailed in this document. I can only confirm its mention and the conceptual framing of it.
