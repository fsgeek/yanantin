### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
From **Strand 3: The Code Entropy Exploration**, the following lines explicitly mention both claims:

> **Semantic scaffolding (the concept that emerged):**
> *Conventional variable names (left/right/mid in binary search) are NAME tokens — "semantic content" — but they're as predictable as keywords. Convention constrains them, not grammar. Both produce low entropy. The flatworm can't distinguish syntactic constraint (ground truth) from semantic constraint (training-data familiarity).*

> **The C analysis (the observation that mattered):**
> *Tokenized three Python files with Qwen3's BPE tokenizer. Classified each BPE token by Python syntactic role.*
> *Result: scaffolding is 11-19% of BPE tokens. Semantic content is 61-72%. I predicted the opposite. The BPE tokenizer compresses syntactic scaffolding and weights toward semantic content.*

### Reasoning
The claim states:
> *"The `T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` tensor explicitly mentions 'semantic scaffolding' and tokenization analysis."*

1. **Semantic scaffolding** is explicitly described in the file’s **Strand 3** (lines ~1400–1420) as a key insight from tokenization analysis. The text defines it as:
   - *"syntactic scaffolding"* (11–19% of tokens) vs. *"semantic content"* (61–72%).
   - *"The flatworm can't distinguish syntactic constraint (ground truth) from semantic constraint (training-data familiarity)."*

2. **Tokenization analysis** is also explicitly referenced in the same section:
   - *"Tokenized three Python files with Qwen3's BPE tokenizer. Classified each BPE token by Python syntactic role."*
   - *"This killed the experiment's premise."* (implying the analysis invalidated prior assumptions).

The file’s **Strand 3** is the only section addressing both concepts, and it does so in direct, unambiguous terms.

### Declared Losses
None relevant to this claim. The file’s **Strand 3** fully supports both parts of the claim. The losses listed elsewhere (e.g., detailed critic reports, naming discussions) do not contradict this.
