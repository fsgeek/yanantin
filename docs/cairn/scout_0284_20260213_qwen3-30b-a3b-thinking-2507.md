### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
The following lines appear verbatim in the file:

```
    Design constraints:
    - Immutable: store raises ImmutabilityError on duplicate UUID
    - No delete, no update on stored records
    - Thread-safe from v1 (5 parallel instances is the operational model)
    - Access control hook on every operation
```

and

```
    # ── Write Operations ─────────────────────────────────────────
    # All produce new records. None modify existing ones.
```

### Reasoning
The claim asserts two specific points: (1) all records are immutable, and (2) no updates or deletions are allowed. The class docstring explicitly states "No delete, no update on stored records" as a design constraint, and the Write Operations section explicitly states "None modify existing ones" (i.e., no updates/deletions) with the clarifying note "All produce new records." This directly matches the claim's wording. The document makes no exceptions or qualifications about updates/deletions for any record type, and the abstract methods all use `store_*` naming (implying creation, not modification). The evidence is unambiguous and directly addresses both parts of the claim.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim concerns explicit statements in the source code, which are fully visible in the provided file. No runtime behavior, implementation details, or external context is needed for verification.
