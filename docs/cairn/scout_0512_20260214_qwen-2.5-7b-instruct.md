### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
The docstring of `tests/integration/test_arango_real.py` states:
```python
"""Integration tests for ArangoDB backend against REAL ArangoDB instance.
```
This matches the claim's reference to `tests/integration/test_arango_real.py` as an integration test.

### Reasoning
The file `tests/integration/test_arango_real.py` is clearly labeled as integration tests for an ArangoDB backend. The docstring explicitly mentions that these tests are conducted against a real ArangoDB instance and do not use mocks or fakes. Since the claim specifies that the docstring states "Integration tests for ArangoDB backend against REAL Arango_real_database," the evidence from the file confirms this claim.

### Declared Losses
No specific parts of the codebase were inaccessible or unclear that would lead to any undeclared losses. The entire file was checked and confirmed to match the claim.
