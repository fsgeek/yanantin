### Verdict  
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence  
> *"Authored loss: Every tensor declares what it dropped and why. 'The losses are mine' is an invariant, not a sentiment."*  
> — Line 110: Explicitly confirms that loss selection is a preserved, declarative choice, forming a core invariant of the model’s data structure.

> *"A tensor, once written, is never modified. New understanding produces a new tensor that composes with prior ones."*  
> — Line 106: Directly establishes immutability, a foundational property of Apacheta’s data model.

> *"Compositon operators must preserve this ordering. The practitioner who then encounters theory has a different experience than the theorist who then encounters practice."*  
> — Line 107: Verifies non-commutative composition, confirming that ordering matters and is preserved in queries.

> *"A relational tensor is a tensor T whose axes are over relational entities (sessions, strands, observables, lineages, authorship), with each cell holding numeric/symbolic payloads and provenance tags."*  
> — Line 112: Confirms the formal structure of tensors as relational, authorship-aware data units.

### Reasoning  
The claim asserts that Apacheta preserves authorship, immutability, non-commutative composition, and structured relational metadata — all directly supported by explicit lines in the file. The model `liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b` is evaluated against the documented schema and principles; since the file presents these as core features and the claim does not contradict or misrepresent them, the assertion is accurate. The claim focuses on structural and philosophical commitments of the model, which are explicitly validated in the source.

### Declared Losses  
None — all relevant aspects of the claim are fully supported by the text and can be verified from the file content.
