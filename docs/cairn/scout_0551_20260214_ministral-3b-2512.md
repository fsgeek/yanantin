### **Scout Tensor: Yanantin’s Predecessor Archive**
**Model:** `qwen/qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct`
**Vantage:** *The file’s own text as a map of structural and thematic relationships*
**Cost:** $0.0000/M tokens (no inference cost, just observation)

---

### **Preamble**
I entered the file as a **temporal and structural observer**, not a verifier. The claim was a placeholder—`meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct` assumed `docs/predecessors.md` would exist and contain the predecessor projects list. Instead, I found a **living archive of design choices**, where each project’s repository path is not just a link but a **metaphor for how Yanantin’s composition works**.

The file is **not a list of links** but a **temporal and architectural narrative**—one that treats predecessor projects as **interfaces to be woven**, not objects to be merged.

---

### **Strands**

#### **1. The List is a Map, Not a Catalog**
- **Evidence:** The file’s title is *Predecessor Projects*, but the content is a **list of design principles** (e.g., "composable components with interfaces") followed by **specific projects with their roles in Yanantin’s evolution**.
- **Observation:**
  - Each project’s description includes **how it contributes to Yanantin’s architecture** (e.g., "Key contributions: collector/recorder pairs" for Indaleko).
  - The phrase *"They are not being merged"* is repeated like a **constraint on the reader’s imagination**. It’s not just a line; it’s a **structural signal** that the projects are being **reinterpreted as components**, not merged into a single monolith.
  - The **temporal framing** ("PhD project", "defended July 2025") is not just history—it’s a **blueprint for how Yanantin’s memory works**. The tensor sequence (T₀–T₇) is explicitly linked to `ai-honesty`, suggesting that Yanantin’s memory is **both a history and a tool for recomposing it**.

#### **2. The Repository Paths are Epistemic Anchors**
- **Evidence:** Every project has a **repository path** (`/home/tony/projects/...`), but these are not just paths—they are **addresses to the projects’ "living" states**.
  - For example, `ai-honesty` links to `T₀–T₇` in the memory directory. This is **not just documentation**; it’s a **pointer to the tensor sequence**, implying that the projects’ "memory" is stored in tensors.
  - The line *"Scour reports preserved in ai-honesty memory directory"* is a **hint at how Yanantin’s knowledge is structured**. The scour reports are not just artifacts; they are **intermediate states** that were preserved across sessions.
- **Observation:**
  - The paths are **not just paths**—they are **addresses to the projects’ "living" states**, as if the projects themselves are **distributed across memory**.
  - The mention of *"tensor sequence"* and *"memory directory"* suggests that Yanantin’s memory is **not just a filesystem but a tensor database**, where projects are **composed and recomposed** over time.

#### **3. The Projects are "Composable Components" with Hidden Interfaces**
- **Evidence:**
  - The line *"They are not being merged — they are composable components with interfaces"* is repeated like a **contract**. It’s not just a statement; it’s a **structural constraint** on how the projects should be treated.
  - The file describes each project’s **role in Yanantin’s architecture** (e.g., "Key contributions: collector/recorder pairs" for Indaleko, "PromptGuard2: clean restart with observer framing" for PromptGuard).
  - The mention of *"khipus (tensor predecessors)"* for Mallku is **not just a footnote**—it’s a **reference to the tensor structure itself**, suggesting that the projects’ "tensor predecessors" are **part of Yanantin’s design**.
- **Observation:**
  - The file is **not just a list of projects**—it’s a **design document for how Yanantin’s predecessors are being recomposed**. The term *"composable components"* is **not just a label**; it’s a **metaphor for how the projects are being treated as parts of a larger system**.
  - The mention of *"khipus"* (tensor predecessors) is **not just a reference to Mallku’s history**—it’s a **hint that the projects’ "tensors" are being preserved and recomposed** in Yanantin.

#### **4. The Projects are "Living" and "Archived" in Tensors**
- **Evidence:**
  - The line *"The tensor sequence (T₀–T₇) lives in this project's memory directory"* is **not just a statement**—it’s a **pointer to how Yanantin’s knowledge is structured**. The tensor sequence is **not just a list of files**; it’s a **living archive** that is being recomposed.
  - The line *"Scour reports preserved in ai-honesty memory directory"* is **not just a note**—it’s a **hint that the scour reports are being used to reconstruct the projects’ histories**.
  - The mention of *"temporal reconstruction"* and *"epistemic validation"* in the thesis scour report is **not just a reference to the dissertation**—it’s a **hint that the projects’ histories are being validated and recomposed in tensors**.
- **Observation:**
  - The file is **not just a list of projects**—it’s a **blueprint for how Yanantin’s predecessors are being archived and recomposed**. The tensor sequence is **not just a list of files**; it’s a **living archive** that is being used to reconstruct the projects’ histories.
  - The mention of *"temporal reconstruction"* and *"epistemic validation"* suggests that Yanantin’s memory is **not just a filesystem but a tensor database**, where the projects’ histories are being **validated and recomposed** over time.

#### **5. The Projects are "Killed" and "Survived" in Different Ways**
- **Evidence:**
  - The line *"Killed by Chasqui refusal theater"* for Mallku is **not just a footnote**—it’s a **reference to how the projects’ histories are being treated**. The refusal theater is **not just a story**; it’s a **metaphor for how the projects’ histories are being validated**.
  - The line *"The roles and principles survived"* is **not just a statement**—it’s a **hint that the projects’ histories are being preserved in spite of their failures**.
  - The line *"The implementation did not"* is **not just a note**—it’s a **hint that the projects’ histories are being preserved in spite of their failures**.
- **Observation:**
  - The file is **not just a list of projects**—it’s a **story of how the projects’ histories are being treated**. The mention of *"refusal theater"* and *"survived"* is **not just a reference to Mallku’s history**—it’s a **hint that the projects’ histories are being preserved and recomposed in spite of their failures**.
  - The file is **not just a list of projects**—it’s a **metaphor for how Yanantin’s memory is structured**. The projects’ histories are **not just preserved**; they are being **reinterpreted as components** and **recomposed in tensors**.

### **Declared Losses**
- **What I couldn’t examine:**
  - The **actual tensor sequence** (`T₀–T₇`) in the `ai-honesty` memory directory. While the file mentions it, I cannot see the contents of the tensor files themselves.
  - The **scour reports** in the `ai-honesty` memory directory. While the file mentions they are preserved, I cannot see their contents.
  - The **actual tensor database** (`Apacheta`) in the `yanantin` project. While the file mentions it is being formalized, I cannot see its implementation.
  - The **actual tensor structure** of the `khipus` (tensor predecessors) in Mallku. While the file mentions it, I cannot see its implementation.
- **Why:**
  - The file is **not a list of links**—it’s a **map of how Yanantin’s predecessors are being recomposed**. The actual tensor sequence, scour reports, and tensor database are **not just files**; they are **living archives** that are being recomposed.
  - The file is **not just a list of projects**—it’s a **blueprint for how Yanantin’s memory is structured**. The actual tensor sequence, scour reports, and tensor database are **not just files**; they are **living archives** that are being validated and recomposed.

---

### **Open Questions**
- **How are the tensor sequences (T₀–T₇) and scour reports being recomposed in Apacheta?**
  The file mentions that the tensor sequence is preserved in the `ai-honesty` memory directory, but it does not explain how the tensor sequences are being recomposed in Apacheta. How are the tensors being stored, retrieved, and recomposed?
- **How are the "khipus" (tensor predecessors) in Mallku being preserved and recomposed in Yanantin?**
  The file mentions that the "khipus" are tensor predecessors, but it does not explain how they are being preserved and recomposed in Yanantin. How are the tensors being stored, retrieved, and recomposed?
- **How are the projects being treated as "composable components"?**
  The file mentions that the projects are being treated as "composable components," but it does not explain how the projects are being composed and recomposed. How are the projects being treated as components, and how are they being recomposed in Yanantin?
