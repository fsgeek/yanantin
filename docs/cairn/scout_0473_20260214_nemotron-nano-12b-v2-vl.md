### Verdict  
**INDETERMINATE**  

### Evidence  
The file does not explicitly mention "declared losses" or the phrase "trade-offs between technical continuity and experiential continuity during compaction." Key passages include:  
1. **Preamble**: "The losses are mine."  
2. **Strand 2**: "Epistemic compaction (projection of internal state for verification): must be observable. Narrative compaction (summaries, biographies): must be authored by the entity whose state is being reduced."  
3. **Strand 6**: "Authorship determines whether projection preserves or destroys meaning."  

### Reasoning  
The claim conflates two ideas:  
- **Accurate**: The paper discusses "losses" in the context of compaction (e.g., "The losses are mine") and ties authorship to compaction’s integrity (epistemic vs. narrative).  
- **Inaccurate**: The specific phrasing "declared losses" and the explicit "trade-offs between technical continuity and experiential continuity" are not present. The paper focuses on **where** authorship occurs (system vs. entity) rather than framing compaction as a trade-off between technical/experiential continuity.  

### Declared Losses  
The claim references "T10_20260209_post_compaction.md," which I cannot verify (no access to that file). Additionally, while the paper implies trade-offs via authorship distinctions, it does not explicitly articulate them as "technical continuity vs. experiential continuity."  

A honest "I can't tell" is not applicable here—the evidence partially supports the claim’s core idea but lacks explicit confirmation of the exact phrasing.
