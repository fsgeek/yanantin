### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The `evolve.py` file contains the following definition for the `SchemaEvolutionRecord` class:

```python
record = SchemaEvolutionRecord(
    from_version=from_version,
    to_version=to_version,
    fields_added=fields_added or [],
    fields_removed=fields_removed or [],
    migration_notes=migration_notes,
    provenance=provenance or ProvenanceEnvelope(),
)
```

### Reasoning
The claim suggests that adding a `schema_version` field to `TensorRecord` and a `migrate()` hook in `evolve.py` would help future scouts spot the trigger. However, the provided file does not contain any references to either `TensorRecord` or a `migrate()` hook.

1. **`TensorRecord`**: The file uses `SchemaEvolutionRecord`, but there is no mention of `TensorRecord`. The claim assumes the existence of `TensorRecord`, but it is not present in the provided code.

2. **`migrate()` hook**: There is no function or method named `migrate()` in the `evolve.py` file. The main function is `evolve()`, which handles schema evolution, but it does not include a `migrate()` hook.

Since the file lacks both `TensorRecord` and a `migrate()` hook, the claim cannot be confirmed. The provided evidence shows that the file does not contain the elements mentioned in the claim.

### Declared Losses
- **Absence of `TensorRecord`**: The claim references `TensorRecord`, but this class or concept is not present in the provided file. Without its definition or usage, it is not possible to verify its relevance.
- **Absence of `migrate()` hook**: The claim mentions a `migrate()` hook, but no such function or method exists in the file. This part of the claim cannot be evaluated based on the provided content.

The verdict is **DENIED** because the file does not contain the elements referenced in the claim.
