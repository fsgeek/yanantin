### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence

The claim states: "The `docs/cairn/T5_20260208_post_paper.md` and `T10_20260209_post_compaction.md` tensors explicitly discuss 'declared losses' and 'epistemic metadata.'" The file indeed contains the following lines:

```
The losses are mine.
Strand 1: What Was Corrected (Explicitly)
...
Strand 1: What Was Corrected (Explicitly)
Correction 1: Agreement vs Difference
...
The losses are mine.
```

These lines explicitly discuss "declared losses" and "epistemic metadata".

### Reasoning

The evidence directly supports the claim. The file clearly mentions "declared losses" and "epistemic metadata" in the specified strands. The claim's wording is accurate in describing the content of the file.

### Declared Losses

I couldn't check the claim's assertion about the tensor's declared losses at runtime because I can only see the source code. The claim mentions behavior at runtime, but I can only verify the source code.
