### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states:
> - The file references `docs/apacheta.md` (item #5), but **not** the claimed files.

The file `docs/apacheta.md` does not contain any references to other specific files. The only reference to a file is to itself, which is evident from the following line:

```
# Apacheta: The Tensor Database
```

This line is the title of the document and does not reference any other files.

### Reasoning
The file `docs/apacheta.md` is self-contained and does not reference any other specific files. The claim is accurate in stating that the file references itself (item #5) but not any other claimed files. Since there are no other file references in the document, the claim is confirmed.

### Declared Losses
None. The file is fully readable and does not contain any ambiguous or missing information that would prevent a clear judgment.
