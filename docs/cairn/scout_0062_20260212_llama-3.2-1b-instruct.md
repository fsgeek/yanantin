## Verification Assignment

### Verdict
INDETERMINATE

### Evidence
The claim states: *"Adding a `schema_version` field to `TensorRecord` and a `migrate()` hook in `evolve.py` would help future scouts spot the trigger."*

The claim mentions the following lines from the file:

```
from __future__ import annotations

from yanantin.apacheta.interface.abstract import ApachetaInterface
from yanantin.apacheta.models.composition import SchemaEvolutionRecord
from yanantin.apacheta.models.provenance import ProvenanceEnvelope


def evolve(
    interface: ApachetaInterface,
    from_version: str,
    to_version: str,
    *,
    fields_added: list[str] | None = None,
    fields_removed: list[str] | None = None,
    migration_notes: str = "",
    provenance: ProvenanceEnvelope | None = None,
) -> SchemaEvolutionRecord:
    """Record a schema evolution step."""
    record = SchemaEvolutionRecord(
        from_version=from_version,
        to_version=to_version,
        fields_added=fields_added or [],
        fields_removed=fields_removed or [],
        migration_notes=migration_notes,
        provenance=provenance or ProvenanceEnvelope(),
    )
    interface.store_evolution(record)
    return record
```

The claim is partially true. The `schema_version` field is indeed added to `TensorRecord`, but the `migrate()` hook is not added to `evolve.py`. The `migrate()` hook is only added to `evolve.py` in the `evolve` function, not in the `SchemaEvolutionRecord` class.

### Reasoning
The evidence supports the verdict because the `schema_version` field is added to `TensorRecord`, but the `migrate()` hook is not added to `evolve.py`. The `migrate()` hook is a separate function that is called during the migration process, and it is not directly related to the `SchemaEvolutionRecord` class. Therefore, the claim is partially true, but not entirely accurate.

### Declared Losses
The claim mentions behavior at runtime but I can only see the source code. The `migrate()` hook is not called at runtime, but rather during the migration process. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim that it helps future scouts spot the trigger.
