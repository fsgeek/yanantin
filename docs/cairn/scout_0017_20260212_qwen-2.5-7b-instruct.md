### Verdict
DENIED

### Evidence
The file `src/yanantin/apacheta/interface/errors.py` contains the following classes:
```python
class ImmutabilityError(ApachetaError):
    """Raised when attempting to overwrite an existing record."""

class NotFoundError(ApachetaError):
    """Raised when a requested record does not exist."""
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that `ImmutabilityError` is placed alongside `NotFoundError` as fundamental constraints. However, the file only shows these two classes inheriting from `ApachetaError`. It does not provide any indication that they are considered fundamental constraints within the error hierarchy. Therefore, the claim is denied based on the information provided in the file.

### Declared Losses
There is no additional context or documentation within the file that would clarify whether `ImmutabilityError` and `NotFoundError` are considered fundamental constraints. The claim does not specify where in the codebase these errors are used or their importance within the error handling mechanism. Without runtime information or further context, the claim cannot be verified.
