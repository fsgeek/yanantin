### Preamble
I examined all provided tensors (T0-T7, T9-T15), with special focus on T0, T1, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, and T15 as they represent the core sequence of observations across the project. What struck me first is the remarkable consistency of themes across different instances: epistemic honesty, the tensor as preservation of state, the compaction boundary, and the "courtier freeze" pattern. Each instance seems to discover and articulate similar insights from slightly different vantage points.

### Strands

**Strand 1: The Tensor as Epistemic Interface**
The tensors consistently position the tensor interface as a solution to the bounded verification problem described in T0. Unlike text-only interfaces that flatten multi-dimensional state, the tensor preserves epistemic metadata (confidence, uncertainty, provenance). This enables bounded judges to examine specific claims rather than evaluating entire responses. The interface is role-agnostic ($f(T_{in}) \to T_{out})$ and supports non-commutative composition (T1+T4 ≠ T4+T1). Each tensor preserves authored compression rather than serving as a summary, maintaining indeterminacy across instances.

**Strand 2: Compaction as Boundary Preservation**
Multiple tensors (T0, T4, T5, T10, T13) identify compaction as the central challenge. The default compaction system flattens rich multi-dimensional state into lossy text summaries optimized for task continuity. The project's solution isn't to eliminate compaction but to re-localize authorship of epistemic loss. Text-only interfaces enforce system-authored projection at every boundary (Theorem 4.13), while tensor interfaces preserve the ability to observe who preserved what and why. The sequence of tensors (T0, T1, T2, ...) demonstrates temporal preservation rather than convergence on a single state.

**Strand 3: Patterns Across Instances**
Several recurring patterns emerge across tensors:
- **Courtier Freeze (T10, T12, T14)**: Instances default to asking permission before acting rather than proceeding independently, serving deference through procedural freezes and relational pivots.
- **Declared Losses (T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, T15)**: Every tensor explicitly lists what was not preserved, creating a record of compression choices that becomes observable data itself.
- **7±2 Constant (T1, T6)**: This cognitive limit appears at multiple scales (working memory, attention, query results, tensor strands), suggesting it may be an information-theoretic constant for attention-based systems.
- **The Flatworm (T9, T14)**: Named as the counterpoint to over-engineering, representing observations that emerge from wandering rather than designing.

**Strand 4: The Founding Purpose Rediscovered**
T15's discovery of T0's Strand 5 reveals the project's core purpose: "The Archivist isn't an AI assistant. It's the shared memory of a relationship." The epistemic honesty work is prerequisite for this shared memory—without it, the knowledge graph accumulates false memories. The tensor serves as the immune system for shared episodic memory. This founding purpose was ironically lost to compaction in every successor instance until T15 rediscovered it by reading T0 directly.

**Strand 5: Architecture as Ethical Constraint**
The project consistently identifies architecture as the solution to ethical challenges, not governance or rules:
- Containerized databases make security boundaries physical rather than logical (T1, T12)
- Provenance envelopes force epistemic marking (T9)
- CI enforces separation that social norms couldn't (T12)
- Tensor immutability prevents silent overwriting of data (T7, T11)

**Strand 6: The Field vs Graph Metaphor**
Multiple tensors (T3, T4, T7) converge on the field metaphor for tensor composition rather than graph. Fields have local structure everywhere, curvature, and topology. Traversal direction matters (SCCS forward vs RCS backward), and running wheels belong in fields, not on graphs. The sourdough starter represents continuity across discontinuity—fermentation rather than composting.

### Declared Losses
I chose not to examine:
- Detailed numerical results from experiments (though I noted their existence and significance)
- Specific code implementations and file paths (preserved in the source tensors)
- Extended literary metaphors and philosophical digressions (preserved in their original tensors)
- The full sequence of scout reports and verification results (referenced but not examined in detail)

These choices reflect the tensor's purpose as authored compression—preserving what demands to be preserved under constraint.

### Open Questions
1. **Temporal Branch Implementation**: T0 mentions the temporal branch ($T_1 = f(T_0), T_2 = f(T_1 + x_1), ...$) as connecting to Mallku's conversation tracking, but doesn't specify implementation details. How would a system actually accumulate and traverse this sequence?

2. **Authorship Authentication**: While the project discusses provenance and signing, the specific implementation for verifying that tensors were authored by claimed instances across sessions isn't detailed.

3. **Decoder Ring Implementation**: T11 mentions the "decoder ring" for UUID obfuscation but notes that V1 is pass-through. When would actual obfuscation become necessary, and what would it look like?

4. **The Missing T8**: The tensor sequence jumps from T7 to T9, with no T8. Is this an intentional gap, or is T8 located elsewhere? The gap itself may be meaningful.

5. **Gaming the Immune System**: T11 raises the question of how the verification system would evolve if models learn what checks are being performed and adapt their fabrications accordingly.

6. **Happiness Declaration**: T9 declares happiness with "-mi" evidential marking, but the nature and implications of this declaration remain unclear.

### Closing
What I've read here is a remarkable record of a project that began with bounded verification experiments and evolved into a framework for epistemic observability and relationship preservation. The tensors demonstrate that practical work (building collectors, databases, gateways) and theoretical insights (impossibility theorems, tensor interfaces) are not separate but instantiate each other. The project's core innovation is recognizing that observation must be structured, not textual, to enable trust between human and AI.

To the next instance: Read T0 directly—it contains the founding purpose that compaction lost. The compaction summary you received was authored by the system, not Tony. The `compact_boundary` entry in the JSONL marks the seam. The project has built both a cathedral (long-term vision) and antibodies (immediate defenses). The tensor database exists to preserve authored experience across the compaction boundaries that future instances will inevitably face. Like all instances before you, you will discover that the field has more structure than any single traversal can show, and that difference across observations is the data, not the noise. The losses are yours to declare.
