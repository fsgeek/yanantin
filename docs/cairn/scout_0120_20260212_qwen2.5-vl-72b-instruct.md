### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
```python
# Explicit composition declarations
(
    re.compile(
        r"(?:this\s+tensor\s+)?(?:does\s+not|doesn't|does\s+NOT)\s+compose\s+with\b",
        re.IGNORECASE,
    ),
    "does_not_compose_with",
    "high",
    "explicit non-composition declaration",
),
(
    re.compile(
        r"(?:this\s+tensor\s+)?composes?\s+with\b",
        re.IGNORECASE,
    ),
    "composes_with",
    "high",
    "explicit composition declaration",
),
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that `weaver.py` parsing rules appear tuned for Jamesite-GBMs (T₁ references "composes"). The evidence from the file shows that there are indeed parsing rules designed to detect phrases related to composition, such as "composes with." Specifically, the second tuple in `_PATTERNS` contains a regex pattern that looks for variations of "composes with," confirming that the file is indeed tuned to recognize such language. This supports the claim that the parsing rules are designed to identify composition-related statements, including those involving "composes."

### Declared Losses
None. The claim is fully verifiable based on the static analysis of the provided source code. There is no runtime behavior or external dependencies mentioned in the claim that would require additional information beyond the source code itself.
