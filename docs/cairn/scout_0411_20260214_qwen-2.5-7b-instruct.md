### Verdict
DENIED

### Evidence
The file `tests/red_bar/test_immutability.py` contains the following comments and code:

```python
"""Red-bar test: Immutability invariant.

A tensor, once written, is never modified. Attempting to store a tensor
with the same UUID must raise ImmutabilityError.
"""

...

def test_duplicate_tensor_raises():
    backend = InMemoryBackend()
    tensor = TensorRecord(preamble="First version")
    backend.store_tensor(tensor)

    # Same UUID = ImmutabilityError. Compose, don't overwrite.
    duplicate = TensorRecord(
        id=tensor.id,
        preamble="Attempted overwrite",
    )
    with pytest.raises(ImmutabilityError):
        backend.store_tensor(duplicate)

...

def test_no_delete_method():
    """The interface has no delete method. This is by design."""
    backend = InMemoryBackend()
    assert not hasattr(backend, "delete_tensor")
    assert not hasattr(backend, "delete")
    assert not hasattr(backend, "remove")
    assert not hasattr(backend, "drop")
    
...

def test_no_update_method():
    """The interface has no update method. Tensors are immutable."""
    backend = InMemoryBackend()
    assert not hasattr(backend, "update_tensor")
    assert not hasattr(backend, "modify")
    assert not hasattr(backend, "patch")
```

### Reasoning
The evidence shows that the file enforces immutability by preventing updates and deletions. Specifically:
- The comment on line 5 states that tensors are immutable and that an attempt to store a tensor with the same UUID should raise an `ImmutabilityError`.
- Tests `test_duplicate_tensor_raises` and `test_no_delete_method`, `test_no_update_method` verify that tensors are immutable and that the backend does not provide methods for deletion or updating.

The claim states that the red-bar tests enforce architectural invariants *in addition to* testing functionality. However, the evidence does not mention any architectural invariants beyond the immutability requirement. The tests focus solely on ensuring that tensors remain immutable and that no methods for deletion or updating exist.

### Declared Losses
The claim mentions architectural invariants in general, but the file does not provide further details or examples of such invariants. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether they are being enforced beyond the immutability requirement.
