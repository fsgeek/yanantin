### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
```
"""Weaver — extract composition declarations from tensor prose.

Reads markdown tensors, finds composition-related language, and
returns structured declarations. Deterministic: regex and keyword
matching only, no LLM calls.

Conservative by design: only extracts declarations where the text
clearly states composition intent. Ambiguous references get low
confidence.
"""
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that the `weaver.py` file "handles the weaving process and the creation of the tensor fields." The quoted documentation at the top of the file explicitly states that the file "extracts composition declarations" and "returns structured declarations." This aligns with the concept of a weaving process, where disparate elements are brought together to form a coherent whole. Additionally, the file defines `CompositionDeclaration` dataclass, which clearly indicates the creation of structured data related to tensor fields. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim is directly supported by the provided file content.
