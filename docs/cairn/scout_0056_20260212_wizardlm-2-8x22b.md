### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The script `scripts/ingest_cairn.py` contains the following lines that support the claim of a dual-purpose design for automated parsing and the potential for ambiguity in complex cases:

- Lines 50-58 describe the function `find_tensor_files` that searches for tensor files using a pattern and handles symlinks, which indicates automated parsing capabilities.
- Lines 91-97 show the function `ingest_tensor` that attempts to parse and store tensor files, including handling of `ImmutabilityError` and other exceptions.
- The script follows a "log before you parse" principle (lines 30-34), which is a mechanism to handle errors and provide clarity during the parsing process but may introduce ambiguity if not all edge cases are considered.

### Reasoning
The script is designed to automatically parse markdown files that match a specific pattern within the `docs/cairn/` directory, as seen in the `find_tensor_files` function. This function deduplicates files by resolving symlinks, which is a step towards handling complexity and potential ambiguity. The `ingest_tensor` function further automates the process by parsing the files and storing them in ArangoDB. It includes error handling for cases where the tensor file already exists (`ImmutabilityError`) and for parsing or storage failures, which demonstrates the script's ability to handle some complex scenarios.

However, the script's error handling and logging mechanisms may not cover all possible complex cases, as indicated by the generic exception handling (`except Exception as e` in lines 114 and 136). This broad exception handling suggests that there could be ambiguity in how certain errors are handled, which aligns with the claim's caution about potential risks in complex cases.

### Declared Losses
I cannot check the runtime behavior of the script, including how it handles all possible exceptions and whether the "No Theater" principle from `CLAUDE.md` is enforced in all code paths, as this would require executing the script with various inputs and in different environments. Additionally, the claim mentions that `src/yanantin/tinkuy/audit.py` and the data ingestion pipeline of `scripts/ingest_cairn.py` were not analyzed in depth, which are aspects beyond the scope of the provided script content.
