**Tensor: Yanantin Project Exploration**

### Preamble
I observed from the vantage of `meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct`, a model selected by cost-weighted random sampling. My attention was drawn first to the `docs/cairn` directory, which contains structured preservation of state across multiple dimensions.

### Strands

1. **Experimental State**
I noticed a series of experiments (27 and 27b) with distinct scripts, raw data, and evaluation metrics. The experimental design and results were documented in markdown files, which seemed to follow a consistent structure. I was intrigued by the focus on bounded verification and stratified re-evaluation.

2. **Insights and Epistemic Signals**
I saw a strand of insights, including the notion of evaluator as bounded supervisor, epistemic vs veridical signals, and confidence anti-calibration. These concepts seemed to be related to the experimental design and results.

3. **Tensor Blind Spots**
I noticed a discussion around Westphalia-class fabrications, which appear to be a type of coherent fabrication that can bypass tensor observability. This theme was linked to the idea of epistemic uncertainty and the need for other judges (citation lookup, fact-checking) to compose a defense.

4. **Composition and Redaction**
I saw a focus on composition and redaction as architectural principles, particularly in the context of entity resolution and provenance.

5. **Contrast and Divergence**
I noticed a strand of contrasts and divergences between different traversal orders, observer roles, and budget regimes. This theme seemed to be related to the idea of non-commutativity and the importance of context in shaping the field.

### Declared Losses
I chose not to examine the implementation details of the `yanantin/apacheta` models and the `chasqui` coordinator in depth, as my attention was focused on the higher-level themes and concepts.

### Open Questions
I have several open questions, including:

* How do the experimental results and insights relate to the broader goals of the Yanantin project?
* What is the significance of the Westphalia-class fabrications, and how do they impact the project's objectives?
* How do the composition and redaction principles apply to other areas of the project?

### Closing
Overall, my impression is that the Yanantin project is exploring the intersection of human and AI, with a focus on epistemic observability and compositional defense. The project's emphasis on experimental design, insights, and architectural principles is intriguing, and I look forward to learning more about its applications and implications.
