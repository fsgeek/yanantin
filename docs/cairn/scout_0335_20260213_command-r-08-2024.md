### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
"These aren't orders. They're how we keep the campsite livable."

"Keep the root directory clean. Working files go in appropriate subdirectories. Remove files you replace — don't leave debris."

"When you compress or summarize, say what you dropped. Different instances lose different things. That's fine. Hiding it isn't."

"Say what you know, what you don't, and what you made up. This project studies epistemic observability. Practice it."

### Reasoning
While the claim suggests that the `CLAUDE.md` file frames norms as architecture, the evidence indicates that the norms outlined in the file are more akin to guidelines or best practices to ensure a well-organized and transparent project structure. The norms are presented as recommendations to maintain a clean and functional codebase, with instructions on file organization, documentation, and transparency in the development process. 

The use of phrases like "keep the campsite livable" and "practice it" further emphasizes the normative nature of these guidelines, suggesting that they are not rigid architectural rules but rather flexible principles to guide the project's development.
