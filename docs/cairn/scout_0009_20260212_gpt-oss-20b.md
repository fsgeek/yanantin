### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file `docs/cairn/conversation_tensor_20260207_session3.md` contains no mention of a “scout prompt” or of any random selection mechanism. The content is a detailed analysis of a tensor conversation, e.g.:

```
# Conversation Tensor T₂: 2026-02-07 Session 3 (Calibration + Recovery)
...
## Strand 1: Human Calibration Results (COMPLETE)
...
## Strand 2: The Length-Entropy Finding ...
...
## Strand 3: What T₂ Resolves from T₀
...
```

There is no line or section that references a scout prompt, random selection, or any related code‑base sampling.

### Reasoning
The claim states that the scout prompt is randomly selected from the codebase (e.g., the given file). To confirm this, the file would need to contain evidence of such a selection process—e.g., a comment or code snippet indicating random selection or references to a scout prompt. The file instead documents tensor operations, calibration results, and research notes, with no trace of a scout prompt or a random selection mechanism. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the file content.

### Declared Losses
None. All relevant lines are visible, and the claim can be evaluated directly.
