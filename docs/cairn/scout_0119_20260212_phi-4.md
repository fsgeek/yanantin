### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The `docs/predecessors.md` file provides a detailed description of various predecessor projects, including their key contributions, findings, and repositories. Here are some key excerpts:

- **Indaleko**: "Unified Personal Index. PhD project for personal data finding... Key contributions: collector/recorder pairs, NER with entity equivalence, activity streams, query pipeline, provenance envelopes, forward prompts (proto-tensors), count-first query design."

- **Mallku**: "LLM community with Fire Circle consensus, Ayni reciprocity principle, khipus (tensor predecessors), guild structure."

- **ai-honesty**: "SOSP 2026 paper on epistemic observability... Key finding: tensor entropy measures training-data familiarity, not truth."

- **PromptGuard / PromptGuard2**: "Prompt conflict detection. Becomes **Pukara** in Yanantin... Triple-layer model: system/domain/unknown."

- **GPN**: "Generative Pedagogical Networks. ICLR-ready. Relationship to Yanantin TBD."

- **Thesis**: "PhD dissertation, defended July 2025. The authored compression of Indaleko. Five scouring agents found buried structure: temporal reconstruction, epistemic validation, self-knowledge, provenance-first design."

### Reasoning
The claim states that the `docs/predecessor.md` file provides valuable context about the project's lineage and the lessons learned from predecessor projects. The file indeed offers a comprehensive overview of various projects, detailing their objectives, key contributions, and lessons learned, which aligns with the claim. Each project is described with specific insights and outcomes, demonstrating the context and lineage of the current project.

### Declared Losses
There are no declared losses as the claim is directly supported by the content of the file. The document explicitly outlines the lineage and lessons from predecessor projects, confirming the claim's accuracy.
