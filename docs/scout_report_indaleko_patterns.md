# Scout Report: Indaleko Patterns for Apacheta

## Design Implications for Apacheta

### 1. Provenance First
Every record wrapped with SourceIdentifier + Timestamp + Data
(IndalekoRecordDataModel). Build for audit, not just retrieval.

### 2. UUID-Keyed Semantics
Attributes identified by UUID, not name. Federation primitive:
two systems agree on meaning by sharing UUIDs, not names.
Privacy-as-architecture (UUIDs are opaque without the mapping table).

### 3. Forward Prompts as Proto-Tensors
ArchivistMemory.generate_forward_prompt() creates authored
compressions crossing instance boundaries. Contains effective
strategies, user preferences, entity clusters, ongoing goals.
These are the direct ancestor of conversation tensors.

### 4. Organic Ontology
Labels created freely from any source, equivalence discovered
post-hoc via Jaro-Winkler (0.85 match, 0.9 auto-suggest).
Bottom-up ontology beats top-down for heterogeneous sources.

### 5. Time as Universal Join Key
Temporal co-occurrence as primary association mechanism across
heterogeneous data. Inverts the usual data integration approach.

### 6. Demand-Driven Persistence
State exists transiently until referenced, then crystallizes.
Copy-on-reference semantics for experiential state.

### 7. LLM as Live Schema Interpreter
Current schema fed to LLM at query time — late binding for
data semantics. Enables schema evolution without breaking queries.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Confidence with no consumer**: Don't record metrics nothing reads
- **Learning without teaching**: Don't build telemetry that feeds nowhere
- **Everything in memory**: Can't survive success if startup loads all data
- **UUID divergence**: Two UUIDs for same concept in own codebase
- **Prompt archaeology**: Version prompts as first-class artifacts
- **Schema strictness defeated by fallback**: Empty dict = no validation

## Key Numbers

- 18,000x speedup from episodic context alignment (if real)
- 7±2 as cross-scale constant for attention-based systems
- Bimodal query performance: sub-10ms or 2.5-3.5 minutes, no middle
