### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states that the `docs/cairn/T5_20260208_post_paper.md` and `T10_20260209_post_compaction.md` tensors explicitly discuss "declared losses" and "epistemic metadata." The file indeed contains the following lines:

* "The losses are mine." (from Strand 1)
* "Epistemic compaction (projection of internal state for verification): must be observable." (from Strand 2)
* "Narrative compaction (summaries, biographies): must be authored by the entity whose state is being reduced." (from Strand 2)

These lines explicitly discuss declared losses and epistemic metadata, supporting the claim.

### Reasoning
The evidence from the file confirms that the claim is accurate. The tensors indeed explicitly discuss declared losses and epistemic metadata, which is a key aspect of the paper's discussion on compaction and authorship.

### Declared Losses
The claim mentions the line "The losses are mine." However, I couldn't check the behavior at runtime or the specific implementation of declared losses, as this information is not available to me.
