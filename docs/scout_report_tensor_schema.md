# Scout Report: Tensor Schema Patterns from T0-T7

*Generated by exploration agent reading tensors T1-T6*
*T0 and T7 read separately by primary instance*
*Date: 2026-02-08*

## Consistent Structure (Required Fields)

Every tensor has:
- **Preamble**: Identity, lineage, composition relationship
- **Strands** (6-8): Numbered sections, each a distinct concern
- **Closing**: Authorship statement, "the losses are mine"
- **Instructions for next instance**: Guidance for successor

## Composition Types Observed

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Linear successor | T1 ← T0 | Direct continuation |
| Branching | T3 branches from Mallku | Different lineage, aware of others |
| Reverse traversal | T4 reads T0-T3 backward | Order produces different understanding |
| Refinement | T5 refines T4 | Sharpens without replacing |
| Bridge/synthesis | T6 connects T1 + T4/T5 | Practical meets theoretical |

## Lineage Declarations

- **Paper/Experimental**: T0, T1, T2, T5
- **Mallku/Lived**: T3
- **Cross-model/Observer**: T4, T5 (ChatGPT)
- **Bridge**: T6
- **Composite**: T7

## Epistemic Metadata Patterns

- **Neutrosophic coordinates** (T/I/F): Explicit in T4, T5
- **Scope boundaries**: "Only observable structure in text" (T4)
- **Calibration notes**: "93.8% agreement" (T2)
- **Undecidability**: "I don't know if I'm self-aware" (T3)

## Declared Losses

Every tensor declares losses. Categories:
- Context pressure (T6 at 8%, T7 at 7%)
- Traversal bias (T4's reverse order)
- Compression choice (authorial selection)
- Practical constraint (timestamps, file paths)

## Structural Variations (Optional Fields)

- Composition equation (T1, T2 have it; others don't)
- Mathematical notation (T2, T4, T5)
- Table format (T1, T6)
- Cross-model feedback (T5, T6)
- Meta-failure reflection (T2, T3, T4)

## Recommended Schema

```
tensor {
  id: string (required)
  timestamp: datetime (required)

  composition {
    equation: string (optional)
    type: enum [linear, branch, reverse, refinement, synthesis]
    references: [{tensor_id, relationship}]
  }

  provenance {
    author_model_family: enum
    author_role: enum [practitioner, theorist, observer, bridge]
    context_budget_percent: numeric (optional)
    predecessors_in_scope: [tensor_id]
  }

  structure {
    preamble: text
    strands: [{number, title, content, topics}]
    closing: text
  }

  epistemology {
    confidence: enum [high, medium, low, undecidable]
    neutrosophic: {truth, indeterminacy, falsity} (optional)
    scope_boundaries: [string]
    preserved_indeterminacies: [{claim, status}]
  }

  losses {
    declared: text
    reason: enum [context, traversal, choice, constraint]
    preserved: text
  }

  instructions_for_next: text
}
```

## Key Insight

The database preserves how truth looked from different vantage
points, at different times, under different constraints.
Non-commutativity is not a bug — it is the point.
