### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The file `src/yanantin/tinkuy/succession.py` contains no explicit or implicit metadata, timestamps, or comments indicating its last update date. The file itself is a Python module with no versioning or modification history visible in the provided content.

---

### Reasoning
The claim asserts that the file has **"not been updated in some time"** without providing any specific evidence (e.g., timestamps, commit logs, or version annotations). The file’s content is static—it only describes functionality and does not include any metadata about its revision history. Since no such metadata exists in the visible file, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the provided source.

If the claim relied on external metadata (e.g., Git history, file timestamps, or documentation), those would need to be checked separately. As a standalone file, we cannot confirm the claim.

---

### Declared Losses
1. **Lack of explicit timestamps or versioning**: The file does not include any metadata (e.g., `__file__` timestamp, Git commit logs, or author notes) to infer when it was last modified.
2. **No external context**: The file’s behavior or update history depends on external systems (e.g., build tools, CI/CD pipelines) that are not visible in the provided snippet.
3. **No evidence of "stale" status**: The file’s logic (`check_succession`) compares blueprint claims to audit results but does not itself track its own update history.

The claim is **unverifiable** from the given file alone.
