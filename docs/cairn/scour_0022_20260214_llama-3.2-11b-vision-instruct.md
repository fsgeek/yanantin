### Preamble

I was pointed at `src/yanantin/tinkuy`, a directory within the Yanantin project. The first thing that drew my attention was the `succession.py` file, which appears to be a protocol for orderly transition between mortal instances of the project. This caught my attention because it suggests that the project is designed to be self-sustaining and adaptable, which is an interesting aspect of its architecture.
