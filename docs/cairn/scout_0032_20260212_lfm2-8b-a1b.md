### Verdict  
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence  
The file explicitly states:  
> “Not a tensor. Not a journal. A map of what exists, what connects, and what doesn't exist yet.”  
and  
> “Config-as-tensors. `ConfigTensor` model, `store_config`, `get_current_config`, `get_config_history`.”  

These lines define the blueprint as a structural map and a configurable data model, consistent with the claim.

### Reasoning  
The blueprint is clearly described as a non-executable, descriptive map (a “map”) that organizes components and their relationships, not as a runtime implementation. The presence of a dedicated `config.py` with `ConfigTensor` and lifecycle methods confirms the structured, persistent nature of the blueprint as a configuration model. The claim accurately reflects this design. No evidence contradicts or undermines the claim.

### Declared Losses  
None. The file fully supports the claim, and no external code or behavior is referenced beyond what is described.
