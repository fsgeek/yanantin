### Preamble
I observed Yanantin's project codebase, which is designed to build composable tensor infrastructure for epistemic observability. My attention was first drawn to the structured review notes in `docs/cairn`, particularly the scouts' reports, as they contextualize the project's broader focus on provenance tracking and tensor schema.

### Strands
1. **Provenance as Structural Invariant**
   - **Observation:** In `tests/red_bar/test_provenance.py`, every record class (e.g., `TensorRecord`, `CompositionEdge`) explicitly requires a `ProvenanceEnvelope`. This enforces immutability and lineage tracking, as seen in `test_stored_records_retain_provenance`.
   - **Thought:** The project treats provenance as a non-optional, fundamental aspect of its design. This aligns with the CLAUDE.md principle of "Provenance Is Structural," suggesting a deep commitment to maintaining the structural integrity of the tensors.

2. **Scout Prompt Engineering**
   - **Observation:** The `scout.py` template includes a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder, generated by `build_file_tree()`. This suggests a focus on contextual awareness, though the tree is truncated at 4 levels.
   - **Thought:** While the file tree construction avoids noise (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`), it may miss deeper directory structures. The `select_files_for_scout()` function prioritizes source files (.py, .md) over binaries, indicating a focus on code and documentation.

3. **Tensor Schema in Documentation**
   - **Observation:** Files like `docs/cairn/scout_0002_20260210_llama-3-8b-instruct.md` show structured tensors with sections like 'Strands' and 'Declared Losses'. The `T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` tensor explicitly mentions 'semantic scaffolding' and tokenization analysis.
   - **Thought:** The project uses markdown as both documentation and data format, enabling automated parsing. However, this dual-purpose design may introduce ambiguity in complex cases, as seen in `docs/cairn/scout_0056_20260212_wizardlm-2-8x22b.md` with the generic exception handling.

### Declared Losses
- **Did not examine `src/yanantin/tinkuy/audit.py` in depth, as focus remained on scout workflows and provenance.**
  - Reason: Time constraints, and the file was not directly relevant to scout workflows.
- **Avoided analyzing `scripts/ingest_cairn.py`'s data ingestion pipeline due to time constraints.**
  - Reason: Time constraints, and the script was beyond the scope of the current observation.
- **Did not verify if `CLAUDE.md`'s 'No Theater' principle is enforced in all code paths.**
  - Reason: Time constraints and the principle was out of the scope of the current observation.

### Open Questions
- **How does the project handle provenance for generated files (e.g., `logs/chasqui.log`)?**
  - This is important because generated files might not have the same provenance metadata as manually authored files.
- **What mechanisms ensure consistency between `docs/cairn` tensors and the actual codebase state?**
  - This question is crucial for understanding how the project maintains consistency between documentation and runtime state.
- **Are there plans to formalize the 'semantic scaffolding' concept into a measurable metric?**
  - This would help in quantifying the effectiveness of the semantic scaffolding in real-world scenarios.

### Closing
The Yanantin project is a compelling blend of human-AI collaboration and technical rigor, prioritizing epistemic observability through rigorous provenance tracking and structured reporting. Scouts act as both observers and architects of this system, driving a tension between human-AI collaboration (e.g., 'Tinkuy' confluence) and technical rigor. The project's focus on provenance as a structural invariant is a defining element. However, the dual-purpose use of markdown for both documentation and data format introduces potential ambiguities in complex cases. The next scout should focus on verifying how these principles scale with larger codebases and more complex tensors, while also addressing the limitations noted in the declared losses.
