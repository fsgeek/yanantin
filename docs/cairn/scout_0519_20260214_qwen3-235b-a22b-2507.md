### Verdict  
**DENIED**

### Evidence  
The docstring of `tests/unit/test_memory_backend.py` is:

```python
"""Unit tests for the in-memory backend."""
```

There is no mention in this docstring — or anywhere else in the file — of mirroring another file, verifying interface consistency with another backend, or any comparison between two backends.

### Reasoning  
The claim states:  
> "The file's docstring explicitly confirms this by stating that these tests mirror `test_memory_backend.py` and serve to verify interface consistency between the two backends."

This is false for multiple reasons:

1. **Self-reference error**: The claim says the tests "mirror `test_memory_backend.py`" — but *this is* `test_memory_backend.py`. A file cannot meaningfully "mirror" itself.
2. **No such content in docstring**: The actual docstring is simply `"Unit tests for the in-memory backend."` — it does not mention mirroring, interface consistency, or any other backend.
3. **No evidence of comparative testing**: While the test suite thoroughly validates the `InMemoryBackend`, there is no test or comment suggesting it exists to verify consistency with another backend (e.g., a disk-based or database backend).

Thus, the claim misrepresents both the content and purpose of the file as stated in its documentation.

### Declared Losses  
None. The claim is about the content of a static file (specifically, its docstring), which is fully available and unambiguous. No runtime or external behavior needs to be observed.
