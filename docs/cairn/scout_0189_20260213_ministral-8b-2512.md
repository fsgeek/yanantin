### Verdict
**DENIED**

---

### Evidence
The claim states:
> *"The `scout.py` file in `src/yanantin/chasqui/` defines the mechanism for dispatching scouts (line 11)."*

The file does **not** explicitly mention `scout.py` or line 11 in any way.
The closest reference to scout-related content is:

1. **Docstring (lines 1-4):**
   ```
   """Scout dispatch — send a messenger into the codebase.
   ```
   (This refers to the *purpose* of the file's content, not the file `scout.py` itself.)

2. **No explicit mention of `scout.py`:**
   - The file does not quote, import, or reference a file named `scout.py`.
   - There is no line 11 in the provided content (the file starts with a docstring, not numbered lines).

3. **No direct evidence of dispatch mechanism at line 11:**
   - The file's first line is `"""Scout dispatch...`, not a code line.
   - The file is a **Markdown tensor** (a record of a model's output), not the actual `scout.py` file.

---

### Reasoning
1. **Claim is about `scout.py`:**
   The claim explicitly references `scout.py` (e.g., *"defines the mechanism for dispatching scouts (line 11)"*), but this file is **not the actual source code**. Instead, it is a **record of a model's output** (a "Chasqui Scout Tensor") describing the behavior of some scouting system. There is no evidence here that `scout.py` exists or contains the described mechanism.

2. **No line 11 in the file:**
   The file does not have line numbers like a code file. The first line is a docstring, and there is no explicit dispatch mechanism at any line number.

3. **The file describes scout behavior, not code:**
   The content is a **verdict** from a model (Mistral) about how scouts *should* work (e.g., file selection, prompt construction). It does not show the actual implementation of `scout.py` or prove that such a file exists with the claimed behavior.

4. **The claim conflates two things:**
   - The file describes the *intended behavior* of scouts (e.g., dispatching, file selection).
   - The claim incorrectly attributes this behavior to a specific file (`scout.py`) that is not shown here.

---

### Declared Losses
1. **No access to `scout.py`:**
   This file is a **record of a model's output** (a "Chasqui Scout Tensor"), not the actual source code of `scout.py`. I cannot verify whether the file `scout.py` actually exists or contains the claimed dispatch mechanism.

2. **No line numbers in the file:**
   The file does not have numbered lines like a code file, so "line 11" is meaningless in this context.

3. **No evidence of file references:**
   The file does not quote, import, or reference `scout.py` or any other file. The claim's assertion about `scout.py` is unsupported by this content.
