### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The claim states:  
> "`format_respond_prompt()` - constructs prompts for response tasks These functions demonstrate that `scout.py` is more than just a prompt preparer - it contains substantial logic for file selection, metadata management, and prompt formatting for different types of interactions."

Relevant functions in `src/yanantin/chasqui/scout.py`:
```python
def format_respond_prompt(
    model: ModelInfo,
    previous_tensor_content: str,
    previous_model_id: str,
    root: Path,
) -> tuple[str, list[dict[str, str]]]:
    """Build prompt for responding to a previous scout's tensor.

    Returns (system_prompt, messages) for the OpenRouter API.
    """
    selected_files = select_files_for_scout(root)

    file_contents_parts = []
    for path, content in selected_files:
        rel = path.relative_to(root)
        file_contents_parts.append(f"### {rel}\n```\n{content}\n```")

    file_contents = "\n\n".join(file_contents_parts)
    cost = model.prompt_cost + model.completion_cost

    user_prompt = RESPOND_TEMPLATE.format(
        model_id=model.id,
        model_name=model.name,
        previous_model=previous_model_id,
        cost=f"{cost:.4f}",
        previous_tensor=previous_tensor_content,
        file_contents=file_contents,
    )

    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}]
    return RESPOND_SYSTEM_PROMPT, messages
```

Also:
```python
def select_files_for_scout(
    root: Path,
    max_files: int = 8,
    max_lines_per_file: int = 150,
) -> list[tuple[Path, str]]:
    """Select a random sample of project files for the scout to read.

    Favors source files and tests. Skips binaries and generated files.
    Returns (path, content) tuples.
    """
    ...
```

And:
```python
def scout_metadata(model: ModelInfo, run_number: int, mode: str = "scout") -> dict[str, str]:
    """Build OpenRouter metadata for cost tracking."""
    return {
        "experiment": f"chasqui_{mode}",
        "model_id": model.id,
        "run_number": str(run_number),
        "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    }
```

### Reasoning
The claim makes two assertions:

1. That `format_respond_prompt()` constructs prompts for response tasks — **this is accurate**. The function clearly does this, as shown in the code.

2. That "these functions demonstrate that `scout.py` is more than just a prompt preparer — it contains substantial logic for file selection, metadata management, and prompt formatting for different types of interactions" — **this is misleading and overstates the case**.

- **File selection**: The `select_files_for_scout()` function exists, but it is a simple randomized sampling function with basic filtering. It does not implement complex logic — just `rglob`, path filtering by name, and random sampling. This is lightweight utility logic, not "substantial".

- **Metadata management**: There is only one function, `scout_metadata()`, which returns a static dictionary with timestamp and model info. Again, this is minimal — not "substantial logic".

- **Prompt formatting for different types of interactions**: There are three prompt formatters (`format_scout_prompt`, `format_respond_prompt`, `format_verify_prompt`), each tied to a fixed template. They are straightforward string formatting functions. While there are multiple types, the logic is not complex.

The file is, in fact, primarily a **prompt preparer**. The claim attempts to elevate the complexity and scope of the logic beyond what is present. The file contains utility functions for sampling files and formatting prompts — but not "substantial logic" beyond prompt preparation.

Thus, while parts of the claim are technically true, the overall characterization is inflated and misleading.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim refers only to the structure and content of the source code, which is fully available. I can assess the presence and complexity of logic directly from the provided file. No runtime behavior or external context is required to evaluate the claim.
