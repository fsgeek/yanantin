### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states that the `scout.py` template includes a dynamic `{file_tree}` placeholder generated by `build_file_tree()`. The evidence supporting this is found in the `format_scout_prompt` function:

```python
file_tree = build_file_tree(root)
```

And in the `SCOUT_TEMPLATE` string:

```python
Here are the files and their structure:

```
{file_tree}
```
```

### Reasoning
The evidence confirms that there is a placeholder `{file_tree}` in the `SCOUT_TEMPLATE`, which is populated by the output of the `build_file_tree()` function. This function constructs a text representation of the project file tree, which is then inserted into the template. Therefore, the claim is accurate as it correctly describes the function and its role in generating the `{file_tree}` placeholder.

### Declared Losses
There are no losses to declare as the claim can be verified directly from the source code.
