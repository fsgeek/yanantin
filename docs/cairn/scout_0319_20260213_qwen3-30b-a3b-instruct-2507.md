### Verdict  
**DENIED**

### Evidence  
The claim states that `entropy_code_experiment_v2.md` "suggests cryptographic foundations" but is inaccurate. However, the document contains no mention of cryptography, cryptographic foundations, encryption, decryption, key management, or any related concepts.  

The closest relevant phrase is in **Set C: Capability Boundary**, where one example prompt is:  
> `def verify_proof(proof_steps, axioms)` — proof verification  

This refers to logical or mathematical proof verification, not cryptography. The rest of the document focuses entirely on code generation, format constraints, token entropy, correctness evaluation, and statistical analysis—specifically in the context of software engineering tasks (e.g., sorting, parsing, scheduling, caching). There is no reference to cryptographic primitives, protocols, or security-related reasoning.

### Reasoning  
The claim asserts that the document "suggests cryptographic foundations," which implies either a direct discussion of cryptography or a clear implication that such foundations are central to the experiment’s design. This is false. The document is centered on epistemic signals in code generation, specifically how per-token entropy correlates with correctness under varying degrees of format constraint. While "verify_proof" might superficially sound like it could relate to cryptographic proofs (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs), the term is used generically for logical validation in a programming context. No other part of the file supports or hints at cryptographic foundations.

Thus, the claim is factually incorrect: the file does not suggest cryptographic foundations, nor does it even touch upon them tangentially.

### Declared Losses  
None. The entire document is available and accessible for analysis. No external behavior, runtime state, or hidden data was required to assess the claim.
