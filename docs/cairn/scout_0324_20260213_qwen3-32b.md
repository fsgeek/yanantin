### Verdict  
**INDETERMINATE**  

### Evidence  
The file `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators/bootstrap.py` defines a `bootstrap` function that:  
1. **Selects tensors/strands for a new instance's budget** (docstring line 1).  
2. Returns a `BootstrapRecord` and selected `TensorRecord`(s) (docstring line 8, code lines 32-33).  
3. **Persisted data** (docstring line 4: "Always persisted. Storage cost ≈ 0. Provenance value > 0.").  

The function's documentation does not explicitly mention "evolve knowledge" or any direct mechanism for knowledge modification/evolution.  

---

### Reasoning  
The claim asserts that the `bootstrap` operator (and others) "represent explicit ways to evolve knowledge." However:  
- The `bootstrap` function's purpose is **initialization/setup** of a new instance's context by selecting existing tensors/strands.  
- While it involves **provenance tracking** and **tensor selection**, these actions are framing the *foundation* of a new instance, not actively evolving knowledge.  
- The test file (`test_operators.py`) confirms the `bootstrap` operator exists and is tested (as shown in the claim), but this alone does not prove it "evolves knowledge" in the asserted sense.  

The connection between "bootstrapping" (initialization) and "evolving knowledge" is **indirect** and requires inferring a broader system-level design intent not explicitly documented in the file.  

---

### Declared Losses  
- **Cannot analyze runtime behavior**: The code defines the operator, but dynamic behavior (e.g., how it interacts with other operators like `evolve`) is not visible from this file.  
- **Ambiguity in "evolve knowledge"**: The term is not explicitly defined in the file, leaving interpretation open.  
- **No cross-referencing**: The file does not reference other operators (e.g., `evolve`), so their relationships are unknown.  

The claim may be partially true in a system context, but the evidence in this file alone does not confirm or deny it.
