### Verdict
**DENIED**

---

### Evidence
The claim states:
> `test_chasqui_files_non_empty(...)` confirms non-empty `chasqui_files` with expected files like `coordinator.py`, `scout.py`.

**No evidence of this claim exists in `src/yanantin/chasqui/coordinator.py`**:
1. **No test function named `test_chasqui_files_non_empty`**:
   The file contains no function, test, or assertion checking for the existence of `chasqui_files` or specific files like `coordinator.py` or `scout.py`. The file is purely implementation code (coordinator logic, async dispatchers, and utilities).

2. **No mention of `chasqui_files` or file validation**:
   The file does not reference a variable or concept named `chasqui_files`. The only file-related logic involves:
   - Path manipulation (`Path`, `PROJECT_ROOT`, `CAIRN_DIR`).
   - Reading/writing files in `write_to_cairn`, `write_scour_to_cairn`, and `dispatch_verify`.
   - No validation or test for file existence/non-emptiness.

3. **No test files or test-related imports**:
   The file imports only core dependencies (`asyncio`, `os`, `httpx`, `logging`, etc.) and internal modules (`yanantin.chasqui.*`). There are no test-specific imports (e.g., `pytest`, `unittest`) or test utilities.

---

### Reasoning
The claim relies on an assertion made by a test function (`test_chasqui_files_non_empty`) that does not exist in the provided file. The file is implementation code for the Chasqui coordinator, not a test suite. There is no evidence that:
- The file validates or checks for non-empty `chasqui_files`.
- The file contains or references tests for file existence (e.g., `coordinator.py` or `scout.py`).
- The file includes any logic to confirm the presence of these files.

The claim appears to conflate implementation code with test assertions, which are not present here.

---

### Declared Losses
1. **No test file visibility**: I cannot verify whether `test_chasqui_files_non_empty` exists elsewhere in the project (e.g., in a separate test directory like `tests/` or `yanantin/tests/`), as the provided file is `coordinator.py` only. The claim references a test function that may reside outside this file.

2. **No runtime behavior**: The file does not include assertions or runtime checks for file existence. I can only verify static code content, not dynamic behavior (e.g., whether a test function would pass or fail).

---
**Final note**: The claim is **DENIED** because the evidence does not support its assertions. The file does not contain the claimed test function or logic.
