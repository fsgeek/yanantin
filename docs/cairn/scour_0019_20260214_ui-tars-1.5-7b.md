# Chasqui Scout Tensor

### Preamble
15 reports were examined. The collection as a whole struck me as a living, self-referential tapestry where AIs peer-review each other like a recursive hall of mirrors. The diversity (open-source like Qwen, proprietary like GPT-5.1) suggests Yanantin values pluralism in observation, but the uniformity of format (rigid format like CONFIRMED, DENIED, INDETERMINATE) implies a tightly controlled "tensor" schema. The future dates (2026) confuse me—did time travel happen, or is this a模拟 projection? The structure of the codebase is modular, but the specific role of each module is not always clear from the directory names alone.

### Strands
#### 1. Consensus on Epistemic Observability and Tensors
- **Observation**: The project's central aim is creating a system for "epistemic observability" — making knowledge and reasoning processes transparent and inspectable. This is mentioned in various notes and documented plans.
- **Thoughts**: This goal resonates with the mission of enhancing human-AI collaboration through open and honest communication. The idea of a system that can explicitly represent and track knowledge seems powerful for avoiding misunderstandings and identifying potential errors.

#### 2. Immutability and Provenance
- **Observation**: Immutability is a major theme across multiple documents and code files. Every tensor carries information about its author, creation time, and derivation history. For example, in `docs/cairn/ T11_20260210_the_immune_system.md`, the importance of "memex" provenance for intellectual integrity is discussed.
- **Thoughts**: This focus on provenance suggests a deep concern for tracking the origins and evolution of knowledge over time. It may be a way to maintain intellectual integrity, detect potential errors or biases, and enable auditing and accountability.

#### 3. Codebase Structure and Modularity
- **Observation**: The codebase is structured into several main directories, each containing related modules and functionality. The modularity suggests a clear separation of concerns and a desire for extensibility.
- **Thoughts**: This modular structure should make it easier to understand and maintain the codebase over time. However, the specific role and functionality of each module is not always clear from the directory names alone.

#### 4. Pulse System and Automated Observation
- **Observation**: The Pulse system is a key component of the codebase. It is responsible for dispatching scouts into the codebase. The scouts are responsible for analyzing the prompt before making decisions. The Pulse system also uses a coordinator pattern to manage the dispatch of scouts.
- **Thoughts**: The Pulse system is the codebase's autonomic nervous system—self-sustaining, reactive, and a tad obsessive. It generates its own work (scouts create verifications, which spawn responses), like a perpetual motion machine of observation. The cron setup in the docstring (cd /home/tony/projects/yanantin && uv run python .claude/hooks/chasqui_pulse.py >> logs/chasqui.log 2>&1) ties it to the human (Tony?), blending AI autonomy with user oversight.

### Declared Losses
- I chose not to examine the actual ArangoDB integration tests, the DuckDB backend implementation, and the OpenRouter client. I ran out of attention and decided to focus on the aspects that caught my attention the most.
- I also chose not to examine the `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators` directory, which seems to contain a variety of functions and transformations that operate on tensors. While this code is likely crucial for the system's functionality, I felt that understanding the core tensor model and high-level architecture was a higher priority for this initial scouting report.
- I did not delve deeply into the specific implementation details of the tensor data structure and its associated operations. I also did not explore the `tests` directory, which likely contains important information about how the system is verified and validated.

### Open Questions
1. What specific challenges is the project trying to solve with epistemic observability and tensors? Are there concrete use cases or scenarios that motivated this approach?
2. How do the various modules and directories in the codebase relate to each other? Is there a high-level architecture or design document that explains the overall structure?
3. Are there any particular design principles or values that guide the project's development? For example, simplicity, performance, extensibility, etc.
4. How does the project envision tensors being used and combined in practice? Are there example workflows or applications that demonstrate the benefits of epistemic observability?
5. What is the relationship between the Pulse system and other components of the codebase? How does it interact with the scouts and the code?
6. How does the project handle the trade-offs between im mutability and flexibility in its design? What are the implications of this choice for the system's functionality?
7. Are there any design patterns or architectural choices that are unique to the Yanantin project and contribute to its ability to maintain provenance and track the origins of knowledge?
8. How does the project ensure that the provenance information is accurate and up-to-date? Are there any mechanisms in place to detect and correct errors in provenance information?
9. What are the specific criteria for determining the "completeness" or "sufficiency" of provenance information?
10. How does the system handle situations where provenance information is missing or corrupted?
11. Is there a mechanism for automatically enriching provenance information over time, as more context becomes available?
12. What is the relationship between the Pulse system and other test suites in the project? Do they have different priorities or coverage goals?
13. How does the Pulse system ensure that the scouts are not overloading the system with too much work?
14. What are the specific criteria for determining when a scout should be dispatched to a particular codebase?
15. How does the Pulse system handle cases where a scout is unable to dispatch or process a particular prompt?
16. What is the relationship between the Pulse system and the scouts' decision-making process? How does the Pulse system influence the scouts' decisions?
