### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states that the `model_selector.py` file prioritizes cheaper models, which impacts the `coordinator.py`'s dispatch logic. The relevant code in `coordinator.py` is:
```python
selector = ModelSelector(
    min_context_length=8_000,
    exclude_patterns=exclude,
)
```
And in the `ModelSelector` class, the `select` method is used to pick a model, but the actual implementation of this method is not shown in this file. However, the `ModelSelector` class is imported from `yanantin.chasqui.model_selector`, which suggests that the model selection logic is indeed implemented in the `model_selector.py` file.

Furthermore, the `dispatch_scout` function uses the `_complete_with_retry` function, which in turn uses the `select` method of the `ModelSelector` class to select a model. The `_complete_with_retry` function is defined as:
```python
async def _complete_with_retry(
    client: OpenRouterClient,
    selector: ModelSelector,
    build_prompt_fn: Callable[[ModelInfo], tuple[str, list[dict[str, str]]]],
    metadata_fn: Callable[[ModelInfo], dict[str, Any]],
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_tokens: int = 4000,
    max_retries: int = MAX_DISPATCH_RETRIES,
) -> tuple[ModelInfo, OpenRouterResponse]:
    ...
    model = selector.select()
    ...
```
This shows that the `select` method of the `ModelSelector` class is used to select a model, and the selected model is then used to complete a task.

### Reasoning
The evidence suggests that the `model_selector.py` file does play a role in selecting models, and that the selected model is used in the dispatch logic of the `coordinator.py` file. While the exact implementation of the `select` method is not shown in this file, the fact that it is used to select a model and that the selected model is used in the dispatch logic supports the claim.

### Declared Losses
The claim mentions the `model_selector.py` file, which is not shown in the provided code. Therefore, I couldn't check the exact implementation of the `select` method and how it prioritizes cheaper models. However, based on the provided code, it is clear that the `ModelSelector` class is used to select models, and that the selected model is used in the dispatch logic.
