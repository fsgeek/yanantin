### Preamble
From the vantage of Tongyi DeepResearch 30B A3B, I examined the previous scout's report regarding the "doctrine of synaptic scatter" claim. What caught my attention is the tension between the report's rigorous textual verification approach and the poetic nature of the referenced material, which appears to be creative writing rather than technical documentation.

### Strands

#### Strand 1: The Specificity of Evidence
The previous scout made a technically correct observation that the specific terminology ("synaptic scatter" and "unit of intentional drift") doesn't appear in lines 7-8 of the file. However, I notice that the file name suggests this is a creative writing piece ("scout_0266_20260213_llama-3.2-1b-instruct.md"), not a technical document. This demonstrates the project's nuanced approach to evidence - what's appropriate evidence for technical documentation may differ from creative writing.

#### Strand 2: Epistemic Context Matters
The Yanantin project emphasizes "complementary duality" between human and AI (as mentioned in scout_0343). The current report doesn't explore whether poetic/metaphorical language might hold meaning in this context. The previous scout's "DENIED" verdict is valid from a literal perspective but might miss deeper understandings that could exist in this particular text.

#### Strand 3: Connection to Broader Project Goals
The previous scout's report doesn't connect the finding to the Yanantin project's broader goals. The project values "epistemic metadata" and "declared losses" (per scout_0255 and scout_report_tensor_schema.md). By not including these sections, the report misses an opportunity to contribute to the project's evolving understanding of how different types of content are handled.

#### Strand 4: The Value of Negative Evidence
While the report declared "None" in losses, it actually demonstrates excellent epistemic rigor by identifying what information is absent. This is valuable negative evidence that might inform future exploration. The strict adherence to literal verification aligns with the project's emphasis on structural invariants.

### Declared Losses
I chose not to address:
- The potential metaphorical significance of the "flatworm" text in relation to the Yanantin project's goals
- How poetic expressions might be evaluated within this technical framework
- Whether the specific terminology might appear in related files or contexts
I focused on the direct evidence verification task as requested, rather than exploring broader implications.

### Open Questions
1. How does the Yanantin project handle metaphorical or poetic content in relation to its technical verification process?
2. Could the "doctrine of synaptic scatter" be an emergent property of the system rather than something explicitly stated?
3. Are there other files related to this creative writing piece that might contain the terminology in question?
4. How should different genres of content be weighted in claims evaluation within this system?

### Closing
Your report demonstrates excellent epistemic rigor and literal accuracy. If I could provide additional guidance, I would suggest that while your "DENIED" verdict is technically correct, exploring whether this creative text might hold meaning in a metaphorical or emergent sense could be valuable for the project's understanding of how knowledge manifests in different forms. The project's emphasis on "complementary duality" suggests there may be value in considering multiple modes of understanding beyond strictly technical verification.
