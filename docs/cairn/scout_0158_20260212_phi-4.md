### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The claim states that `awaq/__main__.py` was not opened, resulting in a lack of a clear picture of the user-facing command set. However, the content of `awaq/__main__.py` provides detailed information about the command-line interface (CLI) entry points:

```python
"""
Modes:
    uv run python -m yanantin.awaq              # Scan cairn, render composition graph
    uv run python -m yanantin.awaq --tensor T15 # Show declarations for one tensor
    uv run python -m yanantin.awaq --json       # Output as JSON
    uv run python -m yanantin.awaq --list       # List discovered tensors
"""
```

Additionally, the script defines various argument parsing functionalities that support these command-line modes:

```python
parser.add_argument(
    "--tensor",
    "-t",
    type=str,
    default=None,
    help="Show declarations for a specific tensor (e.g., T15)",
)
parser.add_argument(
    "--json",
    "-j",
    action="store_true",
    help="Output declarations as JSON",
)
parser.add_argument(
    "--list",
    "-l",
    action="store_true",
    help="List discovered tensors without extracting declarations",
)
```

### Reasoning
The evidence clearly shows that the file `awaq/__main__.py` includes a detailed description of its CLI entry points and the associated command-line arguments that a user can utilize. This directly contradicts the claim that the file was not opened and lacks a clear picture of the user-facing command set. The script explicitly outlines the different modes of operation and includes argument parsing logic for each mode, providing a comprehensive view of the available user commands.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim was specifically about whether the file was opened and whether there is a clear picture of the user-facing command set. The content of the file directly addresses this, allowing for a clear and definitive verification.
