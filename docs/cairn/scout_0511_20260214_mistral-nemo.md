### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `docs/cairn/T1_20260207_seven_projects.md` does mention the "seven projects" lineage, as stated in the claim. The line "Tony opened all seven repositories:" (line 18) is a direct reference to the seven projects.

### Reasoning
The evidence clearly shows that the file discusses the seven projects, confirming the claim made by the other model. The mention of opening seven repositories directly supports the existence and discussion of these projects in the file.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim was specific and verifiable based on the provided file.
