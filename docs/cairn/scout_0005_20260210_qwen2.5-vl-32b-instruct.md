### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim states:  
> - **If you see a `CLAUDE.md`, read it carefully**—it’s not just norms, it’s **architecture**.

The evidence in the file that supports this verdict is found under the **Operational Principles** section:

```
These emerged from failures across predecessor projects. They are
structural, not aspirational — each one exists because something
broke without it.
```

And further:

```
### Provenance Is Structural
Every artifact answers "who made this, when, from what context."
Commits are signed. Tests are authored separately from code.
Data carries lineage. This isn't documentation — it's architecture.
```

### Reasoning
The claim asserts that `CLAUDE.md` is not merely about social norms but also about **architecture**. The file explicitly addresses this by introducing a section titled **Operational Principles**, which discusses structural design choices that are explicitly labeled as "architecture." For example, the subsection **Provenance Is Structural** directly states:

```
This isn't documentation — it's architecture.
```

This line clarifies that the principles discussed are foundational to the project's architecture rather than mere guidelines or norms. The emphasis on structural elements like signed commits, test separation, and data lineage reinforces the architectural nature of the content.

Additionally, the file explicitly calls out that these principles emerged from practical failures in predecessor projects, indicating their importance in the structural integrity of the system. This aligns with the claim that the document is about more than just norms—it outlines the underlying architecture of the project.

### Declared Losses
There are no declared losses. The claim is directly supported by the content of the file, and no additional runtime behavior or external context is required to verify it. The evidence is clear and self-contained within the provided text.
