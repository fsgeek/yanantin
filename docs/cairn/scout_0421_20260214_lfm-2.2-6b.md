### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
The claim states: "The 'declared losses' in scout reports (e.g., not examining certain files) reflect a conscious choice to prioritize verifiable evidence over exhaustive analysis."  
The file's _DDL_ and _TABLE_ configurations do not mention "declared losses" or any preference between analysis methods. The section on claims about `src/yanantin/apacheta/backends/duckdb.py` is about storage and data serialization, not reporting or scouting behaviors.  
Additionally, there is no explicit linkage between file examination omissions and declarative loss reporting in the provided code.

### Reasoning
The evidence shows no direct support for the claim. DuckDB backend logic focuses on database operations, not documentation or analytical priorities. Without explicit references to loss reporting or scout methodologies, the assertion cannot be validated.

### Declared Losses
The code only provides schema and operation methods; "declared losses" aren't documented here. There's no mention of internal decision-making about file examination prioritization.

### Verdict Justification
The claim is denied because the file lacks references to scout reports, declared losses, or any comparable analysis choices.

### Confidence
The analysis relies on thorough content inspection, which identified insufficient alignment between the claim and file contents.

### Final Response
### Verdict
DENIED

### Evidence
`"The 'declared losses' in scout reports (e.g., not examining certain files) reflect a conscious choice to prioritize verifiable evidence over exhaustive analysis."` — this is not supported by the file's content.

### Reasoning
The file discusses database schema, storage, and access control but does not mention scout reports or declared losses.

### Declared Losses
Unverifiable due to missing textual references.

**INDEPENDENT ASSERTS:**  
Since I can't confirm the claim, the correct decision is **DENIED** due to lack of corroborative evidence. If other proofs exist outside this file, they would be needed.
