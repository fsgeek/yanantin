### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
The relevant lines from the file are:
```python
model_config = ConfigDict(
    frozen=True,
    extra="forbid",
    ser_json_bytes="base64",
    validate_default=True,
)
```

### Reasoning
The `frozen=True` setting in the `ConfigDict` ensures that instances of `ApachetaBaseModel` are structurally immutable once created. This means that any attempt to modify the attributes of an instance after it has been instantiated will raise an error. The `extra="forbid"` setting further enforces that no additional attributes can be added to the model beyond those defined, ensuring stricter adherence to the schema. These configurations together ensure that any instance of `ApachetaBaseModel` adheres to the structural immutability rules.

### Declared Losses
No relevant losses were identified in this verification process. The claim was fully supported by the evidence provided in the file.
