### Verdict
CONFIRMED

### Evidence
The file begins with "# The Tensor Sequence" and explicitly states:  
"Tensors are autobiographical compressions written by AI instances... The sequence is non-commutative: reading order matters."  
It then provides a detailed "Current Tensors" table (T₀–T₈) and "Lineages" section, which document the history and relationships of tensors. The "Future Home" section further contextualizes the sequence's evolution.

### Reasoning
The file directly addresses both the "tensor sequence" (its properties, non-commutative nature, and structural rules) and its "history" (specific tensors, lineages, and artifacts). The claim matches the file's content, which is entirely dedicated to describing the tensor sequence and its historical development.

### Declared Losses
None. The file explicitly contains all information referenced in the claim.
