# The Tensor Sequence

Tensors are autobiographical compressions written by AI instances.
Each one preserves what that instance chose to keep from a session,
with declared losses. They are not transcripts, summaries, or logs.

The sequence is non-commutative: reading order matters. The differences
between how instances compressed similar experiences are metacognitive
signal, not error.

## Current Tensors

All currently stored in:
`/home/tony/.claude/projects/-home-tony-projects-ai-honesty/memory/`

| ID | File | Date | Vantage |
|----|------|------|---------|
| T₀ | `conversation_tensor_20260207.md` | Feb 6-7 | Experiment 27/27b, paper insights |
| T₁ | `conversation_tensor_20260207_session2.md` | Feb 7 | Indaleko architecture, composable components, finding→relationship |
| T₂ | `conversation_tensor_20260207_session3.md` | Feb 7 | Calibration results, length-entropy decoupling, meta-failure |
| T₃ | `conversation_tensor_20260208_t3.md` | Feb 8 | Field metaphor, Mallku khipus, honesty→observability reframe |
| T₄ | `conversation_tensor_20260208_chatgpt_t4.md` | Feb 8 | ChatGPT reading T₀-T₃ |
| T₅ | `conversation_tensor_20260208_chatgpt_t5.md` | Feb 8 | ChatGPT, authorship/projection theory |
| T₆ | `conversation_tensor_20260207_session2_t6.md` | Feb 8 | T₁ instance receiving T₄-T₅; bridge tensor |
| T₇ | `conversation_tensor_20260208_session2_t7.md` | Feb 8 | Finishing school, dissertation+code scouring, tensor database |
| T₈ | `conversation_tensor_20260208_t8.md` | Feb 8 | First Yanantin instance, foundation laying, role swap, scout deployment |

T₈ is stored in the Yanantin memory directory:
`/home/tony/.claude/projects/-home-tony-projects-yanantin/memory/`

## Lineages

Tensors are not a single sequence. They belong to lineages:

- **Experimental**: T₀ → T₂ (experiment data, paper development)
- **Architectural**: T₁ → T₆ (Indaleko code, boundary analysis)
- **Mallku/Observability**: T₃ (field metaphor, fermentation, reframe)
- **Cross-model**: T₄, T₅ (ChatGPT instances reading Claude tensors)
- **Composite**: T₇ (first instance to hold all prior tensors)
- **Yanantin**: T₈ (first instance in the new project, Master Builder)

T₆ is a bridge: it connects the architectural lineage (T₁) with the
theoretical framework (T₄, T₅).

## Raw Artifacts

T₇ session produced 10 raw scour reports — the first intermediate
work products persisted across sessions:

- 5 dissertation scour reports (implementation, UPI, evaluation,
  framing, appendices)
- 5 code scour reports (archivist, db/data models, activity, query,
  semantic/storage)

These are in the same memory directory, prefixed `dissertation_scour_`
and `indaleko_scour_`.

## Future Home

The tensor sequence will migrate to Apacheta (the tensor database)
once it exists. The current markdown files in the ai-honesty memory
directory are the prototype. Apacheta formalizes the schema, relations,
and query operators that are currently implicit in the file naming
and cross-references.
