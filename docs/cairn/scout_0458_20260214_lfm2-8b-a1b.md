### Verdict  
**DENIED**

### Evidence  
The claim states:  
> "divarya время Among别ouv W耐旅游 ان schedul militaires..."  

This nonsensical and fragmented phrase contains no reference to `docs/predecessors.md`, `docs/tensors.md`, or any explicit requirement. The file only describes three projects — Indaleko, Mallku, and ai-honesty — with no mention of military scheduling, temporal referencing, or tensor predecessors beyond the context of tensor sequence living in project memory.

### Reasoning  
The file does not support the claim. While the file describes tensor usage (e.g., "The tensor sequence (T₀-T₇) lives in this project's memory directory"), it does not assert that these tensors are *required* or *referenced* by `docs/predecessors.md`. The claim appears to fabricate external dependencies not present in the source.

### Declared Losses  
I could not verify whether the referenced tensor predecessors are truly required by the project, as the file does not state so explicitly. The project documentation focuses on descriptions and principles, not formal dependencies or enforced references. Thus, I cannot confirm the claim’s accuracy.
