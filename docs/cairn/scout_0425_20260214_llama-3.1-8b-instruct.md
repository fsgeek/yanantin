### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file contains the following lines:
```
from yanantin.awaq.weaver import (
    discover_tensors,
    render_graph,
    render_json,
    render_tensor_declarations,
    weave_corpus,
)

def main() -> None:
   ...
    declarations = weave_corpus(sources=args.sources)
   ...
```
These lines show that the `weaver.py` module is imported, and the `weave_corpus` function is used to extract composition declarations, which supports the claim that `weaver.py` and `__main__.py` are central to parsing and exporting composition logic.

### Reasoning
The evidence suggests that the `weaver.py` module is indeed used in the `__main__.py` file to extract composition declarations. The `weave_corpus` function is used to extract these declarations, which is consistent with the claim. The fact that the `weaver.py` module is imported and used in the `__main__.py` file suggests that it is a central component of the parsing and exporting composition logic.

### Declared Losses
None. I was able to verify the claim based on the provided file content.
