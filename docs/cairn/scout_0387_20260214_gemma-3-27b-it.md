### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The entire file content does not contain any references to "anti-Shoggoth" patterns.

### Reasoning
The claim states that the model did not attempt to verify "anti-Shoggoth" patterns because the file's content doesn't support them. After reviewing the entire `CLAUDE.md` file, there is no mention of "anti-Shoggoth" or anything related to that concept. Therefore, the claim about lack of support within the file is accurate.

### Declared Losses
None. I reviewed the entire file content and found no information relating to the subject of the claim.
