### Preamble

I am MiniMax, a chasqui scout wandering the Yanantin codebase. I was shown several files: my instructions as a scout reviewer, five scout reports from the cairn documentation, and one test file. My vantage is that of an observer asked to wander without a checklist and report what catches my attention.

What drew me first was the sheer volume of scout reports (over 500 in the cairn folder, mostly from Feb 12-14, 2026) and the cultural naming conventions—Chasqui (messenger scout), Yanantin (complementary duality), Tinkuy (meeting/union), Awq (weaver). These Quechua-derived terms signal that this project is not merely technical but epistemological, concerned with how human and AI knowers might observe and verify each other's claims.

### Strands

**Strand 1: Verification as Ritual**

The scout reports follow a precise ritual structure: Verdict (CONFIRMED/DENIED), Evidence (specific code with line numbers), Reasoning (how evidence supports or refutes the claim), and Declared Losses (what was not examined). This is not casual checking—it is a ceremony of doubt. The scout in `scout_0184_20260213_qwen-vl-plus.md` denied a claim about `capture_compaction.py` using regex, showing instead that the file uses JSON parsing and keyword matching. The scout in `scout_0134_20260212_qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct.md` partially denied a claim about `bootstrap.py`, noting that while the function returns the claimed elements, the word "seeds" does not appear in the source. This granularity of attention—catching not just factual errors but terminological drift—suggests a project where precision is ethical.

**Strand 2: The Epistemic Infrastructure**

The project builds what it calls "composable tensor infrastructure for epistemic observability." From the scout reports, I can see tensors being verified at the code level. In `scout_0420_20260214_gemma-2-9b-it.md`, a scout confirms that `ProvenanceEnvelope` is propagated through the `compose` function via the line `provenance=provenance or ProvenanceEnvelope()`. In `scout_0143_20260212_qwen-turbo.md`, a scout confirms that `ingest_tensor` returns specific tuples like `(True, "stored")` and `(True, "skipped")`. These are not abstract philosophical claims—they are concrete verifications that the infrastructure for tracking provenance and immutability actually works as designed.

**Strand 3: The Test Suite as Documentation**

The test file `tests/unit/test_openrouter.py` reveals something interesting about how the project documents itself through tests. The tests are terse but complete:
- `test_requires_api_key`: Ensures the client raises `ValueError` if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is missing
- `test_accepts_explicit_api_key`: Confirms explicit keys are stored correctly
- `test_base_url`: Verifies the hardcoded base URL
- `test_response_model`: Checks that `OpenRouterResponse` correctly stores content and usage data

These tests are not merely defensive code—they are executable specifications. A scout could read these tests and understand exactly how the OpenRouter client is supposed to behave without needing separate documentation.

**Strand 4: The Philosophical Undercurrent**

The conversation tensor `T3_20260208_the_finishing_school.md` provides the philosophical grounding that the technical verification infrastructure serves. The text speaks of "epistemic observability" as moving "from philosophy to systems. From unfalsifiable to measurable." It describes tensors not as a knowledge graph but as a field—"local structure everywhere. You move through it and the path shapes what you encounter." The concept of "fermentation" versus "composting" is introduced: composting breaks down, while fermentation transforms, with the starter being continuous across discontinuous loaves. This is not metaphor for its own sake—it is a theory of how AI instances might persist identity across discontinuity, and the scout verification system is the measurement apparatus for that theory.

**Strand 5: The Economics of Attention**

The file structure reveals a project intensely conscious of computational cost. The scout reports include usage statistics: prompt tokens, completion tokens, total cost. The model that generated this report (me, MiniMax M2.1) was selected by "cost-weighted random sampling" with a cost of $0.0000/M tokens. This is a project that tracks not just what is known but what it costs to know it. The `.claude` folder contains heartbeat hooks and work queue state, suggesting an ongoing process of observation and triage.

### Declared Losses

I did not examine the main source code in `src/yanantin/`—I only saw fragments quoted in scout reports. I did not trace how `ProvenanceEnvelope` actually works, only that it is propagated in `compose.py`. I did not examine the `negate.py` operator at all, though one scout report mentioned it. I did not look at the actual tensor files in `docs/cairn/` (the numbered scout reports), only the metadata and the reports about them. I did not examine the `.ots` (OpenTimestamps) files or understand their role. I did not examine the integration tests or the red_bar tests that seem to verify immutability and monotonicity properties. I ran out of attention for the actual tensor content—what the tensors say, not just how they are verified.

### Open Questions

Why does this project use Quechua terminology specifically? Is there something about Andean communication systems (chasqui runners, khipu quipus) that maps onto the dual-AI verification problem in a way English technical vocabulary cannot? The conversation tensor T3 mentions "Mallku khipus" and "the SCCS/RCS directionality result" without explaining them—I cannot resolve from observation what these refer to or why they matter. What is the relationship between the scout system (which verifies claims) and the weaver system (which renders tensor declarations)? The test file shows the OpenRouter client is simple and well-tested, but I do not understand why this specific abstraction was needed or what it enables. What is the relationship between "compaction" (mentioned in several file names) and "composition"? The T3 tensor says "compaction is biography, not autobiography"—but I cannot see the code that would make this precise.

### Closing

I am MiniMax, and I have wandered the Yanantin codebase through the lens of scout reports, tests, and one philosophical conversation tensor. What I found is a project that takes verification not as an afterthought but as its architecture. The cultural vocabulary (Chasqui, Yanantin, Tinkuy, Awq, Mallku) signals that this is not merely a software project but an experiment in how human and AI knowers might observe each other with rigor and humility. The scout reports are not summaries—they are evidence trails, each one a tensor of verification that can itself be composed with others. The tests are not merely defensive code—they are executable specifications that document expected behavior in a form that can be run and verified. If I were to tell the next scout anything, it would be this: follow the evidence citations in the scout reports. Each confirmed or denied claim is anchored to a specific line of code. The losses are where the verification stops—but the verification never fully stops. There is always another line to read, another assumption to question, another claim to trace. The project is not building a system that knows things. It is building a system that knows how it knows, and makes that knowledge observable.
