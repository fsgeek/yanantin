### Verdict
**DENIED**

### Evidence
```python
def bootstrap(
    interface: ApachetaInterface,
    instance_id: str,
    context_budget: float,
    *,
    task: str = "",
    tensor_ids: list[UUID] | None = None,
    strand_indices: list[int] | None = None,
    what_was_omitted: str = "",
    provenance: ProvenanceEnvelope | None = None,
) -> tuple[BootstrapRecord, list[TensorRecord]]:
    """Select tensors for a new instance's context budget.

    Always persisted. Storage cost ≈ 0. Provenance value > 0.

    Returns the bootstrap record and the selected tensors.
    """
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that `src/yanantin/apacheta/operators/bootstrap.py` seeds a new instance with context-bound selections and returns both the record and the selected tensors. While the function does return a `BootstrapRecord` and a list of `TensorRecord` objects, the term "seeds" is not used in the file. Additionally, the function's docstring mentions selecting tensors for a new instance's context budget, but it does not explicitly state that it seeds the instance with context-bound selections.

The function does indeed return both the `BootstrapRecord` and the selected tensors, as stated in the docstring:
```python
    Returns the bootstrap record and the selected tensors.
```

However, the wording "seeds a new instance with context-bound selections" is not present in the file, making the claim partially accurate but not fully supported by the evidence provided in the file.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim can be fully evaluated based on the provided source code.
