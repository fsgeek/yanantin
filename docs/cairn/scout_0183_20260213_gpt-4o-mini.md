### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file `tests/unit/test_ingest.py` contains multiple tests that validate the behavior of the `parse_tensor_file` and `ingest_tensor_directory` functions. For example:
- The test `test_parse_t0_has_strands` includes assertions about the number of strands in the tensor, ensuring it meets expected behavior: 
  ```python
  assert len(tensor.strands) == 6
  ```
- The test `test_key_claims_extracted_from_t0` checks that key claims are extracted from a tensor:
  ```python
  total_claims = sum(len(s.key_claims) for s in tensor.strands)
  assert total_claims > 0
  ```

### Reasoning
The evidence supports the claim that the tests in `tests/unit/test_ingest.py` serve as guardians of the system's behavior, as they assert specific expectations about the output of functions and the integrity of the data processed. Each test checks for specific properties or behaviors of the tensors, confirming that the implementation adheres to the expected specifications. This aligns with the notion of tests acting as guardians, making the claim accurate.

### Declared Losses
There are no losses in verification; all relevant aspects of the claim were accessible in the file. The tests clearly demonstrate the project's philosophy regarding testing behavior.
