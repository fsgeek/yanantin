### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The file contains the following function definition:
```python
def weave_corpus(
    cairn_dir: Path | None = None,
    sources: list[str] | None = None,
) -> list[CompositionDeclaration]:
    """Discover all tensors and extract composition declarations.

    Returns the complete list of declarations across the corpus.
    """
    if cairn_dir is None:
        cairn_dir = CAIRN_DIR

    tensors = discover_tensors(cairn_dir=cairn_dir, sources=sources)
    all_declarations: list[CompositionDeclaration] = []

    for tensor in tensors:
        declarations = extract_composition_declarations(
            tensor.raw_text, tensor.tensor_name
        )
        all_declarations.extend(declarations)

    return all_declarations
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that `weaver.py` is central to parsing and exporting composition logic, and that `weave_corpus` is used to extract composition declarations. The evidence shows that `weave_corpus` is a top-level function that:
- Calls `discover_tensors` to locate all tensor files in the corpus.
- Iterates over each tensor, calling `extract_composition_declarations` on its raw text.
- Aggregates all resulting `CompositionDeclaration` objects and returns them.

This function is clearly the central orchestration point for parsing composition logic across the corpus and exporting the results. The docstring explicitly states it returns "the complete list of declarations across the corpus," confirming its role in parsing and export. The function is not imported elsewhere in this file, but its presence and purpose are definitive.

### Declared Losses
None. The claim is fully supported by the content of `weaver.py` as provided. No external behavior, runtime state, or other files were needed to verify the claim.
