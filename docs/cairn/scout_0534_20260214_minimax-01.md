### Reasoning
The claim states that the file `scout_0245_20260213_llama-guard-3-8b.md` is "just 'safe'—no reasoning, just binary judgment." The content of the file consists of multiple instances of the word "safe" followed by a single instance of "unsafe" and "S5". The majority of the content aligns with the claim that the file is primarily a binary judgment of "safe." The presence of "unsafe" and "S5" does not negate the overall characterization of the file as being largely composed of binary "safe" judgments.

### Declared Losses
The file contains an "unsafe" judgment and an "S5" entry, which suggests that the claim might be slightly oversimplified. However, the predominant content of the file is indeed a series of "safe" judgments, which supports the claim that the file is primarily a binary judgment of "safe."
