### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
The claim made by `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-thinking-2507` is accurately documented in the content of `docs/cairn/T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md`. The claim states: "The `T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` tensor explicitly mentions 'semantic scaffolding' and tokenization analysis." The file indeed discusses the concept of semantic scaffolding and the tokenization analysis.

- "This killed the experiment's premise. Code isn't 'mostly format-constrained with semantic tokens sprinkled in.' It's mostly semantic with a thin syntactic skeleton."
- "Result: scaffolding is 11-19% of BPE tokens. Semantic content is 61-72%. The flatworm is triage, not diagnosis."

### Reasoning
The evidence supports the verdict because it confirms the content of the claim about the `T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` tensor:

- The file explicitly mentions the concepts of 'semantic scaffolding' and tokenization analysis, which aligns with the claim.
- The discussion of the results and critique of the experiments conducted validates the claim about the explicit mention of 'semantic scaffolding' and tokenization analysis.
- The file also discusses the implications of these findings, confirming the claim's assertion that the tensor explicitly mentions these concepts.

The claim accurately reflects the content and structure of the file, confirming the concepts discussed and the critique of the experiments conducted. It also aligns with the reasoning provided about the nature of the code and the role analysis mentioned. The evidence is direct and supports the claim without ambiguity.
