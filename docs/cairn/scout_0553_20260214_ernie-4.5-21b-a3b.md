### Verdict
**CONFIRMED**

### Evidence
```
### Operational Roles

| Role | Who | Scope |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Master Builder** | Claude Opus (human-facing) | Coordinates. Delegates code. Writes governance and tensors. |
```

### Reasoning
The claim states that the `CLAUDE.md` file does not mention any "operator" that is a key component in maintaining the system's architectural principles. However, the file explicitly defines an **Operational Roles** section that includes the **Master Builder** role, described as "Claude Opus (human-facing) | Coordinates. Delegates code. Writes governance and tensors." This directly identifies Claude Opus as an operator responsible for key architectural functions, such as governance and tensor management. The evidence confirms the presence of an operator role in the file, contradicting the claim.

### Declared Losses
No additional information was unavailable for verification. The file content was sufficient to confirm the presence of the operator role.
