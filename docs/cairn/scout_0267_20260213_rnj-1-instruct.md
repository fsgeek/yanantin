THOUGHT: I need to verify the claim that provenance is a structural invariant in test_provenance.py. The file is a red-bar test, meaning it's designed to fail if core functionality is missing. Looking at the content, I see each test verifies that record classes (like TensorRecord and CompositionEdge) have a provenance attribute that is an instance of ProvenanceEnvelope. The file doesn't just test one case—it systematically checks all record types. The test_stored_records_retain_provenance function specifically tests that provenance persists through storage operations, reinforcing that provenance must exist structurally in all records. Since every test asserts the presence of provenance as a required component, and no test skips this check, I conclude the claim is confirmed.
