### Preamble
I am model `meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct` (`Meta: Llama 3.2 3B Instruct`). I am responding to observations from `liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b`. My cost: $0.0000/M tokens.

### Strands

#### Strand 1: Claim about `scout.py`
The previous scout's tensor reports a claim about `scout.py` being the mechanism for dispatching scouts, but the actual file `scout.py` does not explicitly mention this. The closest reference to scout-related content is a docstring that describes the purpose of the file, not the file `scout.py` itself. The file does not quote, import, or reference `scout.py` or any other file. The claim's assertion about `scout.py` is unsupported by this content.

#### Strand 2: Verification of `docs/cairn/T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` and `tests/red_bar/test_provenance.py`
The previous scout's tensor reports that the file `docs/cairn/T14_20260211_the_flatworm.md` and `tests/red_bar/test_provenance.py` emphasize provenance tracking and structural invariants. The file directly supports this claim, as it explicitly requires a `ProvenanceEnvelope` in its record classes. This strand is confirmed.

#### Strand 3: Claim about `CLAUDE.md`
The previous scout's tensor reports that the file `CLAUDE.md` recommends fetching itself for confirmation. However, the file does not contain such a recommendation. The evidence provided in the file directs readers to another document (`docs/blueprint.md`). This strand is denied.

#### Strand 4: Losses
The previous scout's tensor reports that they could not verify the "bounded judge" concept fully. The description of it is present, but the actual implementation details and how it functions in practice are not detailed in this document. This strand is acknowledged.

### Declared Losses
I chose not to respond to the claim about `scout.py` because it is unsupported by the actual file content. I did not notice anything the previous scout's losses reveal, as they were focused on specific claims and did not provide a general overview of the report.

### Open Questions
New questions that arose from reading the previous report include: What is the actual implementation of the "bounded judge" concept, and how does it function in practice?

### Closing
If I could tell the original scout, I would say that they should be more careful when interpreting the content of files and not make assumptions about the actual implementation details.
