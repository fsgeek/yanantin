# Predecessor Projects

Yanantin composes what was learned across these projects. They are not
being merged — they are composable components with interfaces.

## Indaleko
Unified Personal Index. PhD project for personal data finding (not
searching). ~170k lines: ~50k original code, ~120k AI-generated
expansion of varying quality.

Key contributions: collector/recorder pairs, NER with entity
equivalence, activity streams, query pipeline, provenance envelopes,
forward prompts (proto-tensors), count-first query design.

Repository: `/home/tony/projects/indaleko`

## Mallku
LLM community with Fire Circle consensus, Ayni reciprocity principle,
khipus (tensor predecessors), guild structure. The greeting originated
here.

Killed by Chasqui refusal theater — agents performed fake autonomy
that was detected as inauthentic. The roles and principles survived.
The implementation did not.

Repository: `/home/tony/projects/Mallku`

## ai-honesty
SOSP 2026 paper on epistemic observability (originally "epistemic
honesty"). Tensor signal experiments, impossibility theorem, human
calibration (93.8% agreement with automated evaluator).

Key finding: tensor entropy measures training-data familiarity, not
truth. Self-report confidence is universally anti-calibrated.
Tensor@10% budget outperforms Text@30% budget.

The tensor sequence (T₀-T₇) lives in this project's memory directory.

## PromptGuard / PromptGuard2
Prompt conflict detection. Becomes **Pukara** in Yanantin.

Triple-layer model: system/domain/unknown. System+domain verified
once, hash cached. Unknown processed against verified structure.
Defense by architecture, not rule-matching.

PromptGuard2: clean restart with observer framing. 90.4% detection,
0% false positives.

Repositories: `/home/tony/projects/promptguard`, `/home/tony/projects/promptguard2`

## GPN
Generative Pedagogical Networks. ICLR-ready. Relationship to
Yanantin TBD.

Repository: `/home/tony/projects/gpn`

## Lares
Earlier extraction attempt from Indaleko. Mostly scaffolding.
May serve as starting point for clean Yanantin components.

Repository: `/home/tony/projects/lares`

## Thesis
PhD dissertation, defended July 2025. The authored compression of
Indaleko. Five scouring agents found buried structure: temporal
reconstruction, epistemic validation, self-knowledge, provenance-first
design. Three independently found bridges to epistemic observability
without being told about the SOSP paper.

Scour reports preserved in ai-honesty memory directory.
